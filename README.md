# Marshall Rosenberg - Nonviolent Communication - Study Companion

[NVC Instruction Self-Guide](https://www.cnvc.org/online-learning/nvc-instruction-guide/nvc-instruction-guide)

> We live in a world in which violence has become more and more accepted as the norm. It’s all around us. From wars between nations to crime on the street, and even imposing on our everyday existence, violence manifests itself both explicitly and implicitly. Yet for many people, the very idea of violence seems foreign. They are not involved in physical confrontations or abuses, and thus they believe that violence is not present. But the reality is that whenever we become disconnected from our compassionate nature, whenever our hearts are not devoid of hatred in all of its forms, we have a tendency to act in ways that can cause pain for everyone in our lives, including ourselves.
> 
> Nonviolence, then, does not refer to the mere absence of physical harm. It is a way of life that takes its lead from a compassionate and connected heart, and can guide us toward a more complete and happy way of being. As Mahatma Gandhi said, “Nonviolence is not a garment to be put on and off at will. Its seat is in the heart, and it must be an inseparable part of our very being.” It is a practice rooted in understanding, in living honestly, and in acting empathically with all beings. Of course this starts with the self. We must first understand and act empathically towards ourselves in order to impact the world in wonderful and compassionate ways. This means cultivating nonviolence in every action and being present to our own needs and feelings in each and every moment. 

[Nonviolent Communication - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)

> NVC aims to support change on three interconnected levels: within self, between others, and within groups and social systems. NVC is taught as a process of interpersonal communication designed to improve compassionate connection to others. Practitioners also emphasize that it can have many beneficial "side effects" as a spiritual practice, as a set of values, as parenting best practices, as a tool for social change, as a mediation tool, as an educational orientation, and as a worldview.

## Marshall Rosenberg

* [Meet Marshall Rosenberg](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/meet_marshall_rosenberg/vision.htm)
  > Growing up in a turbulent Detroit neighborhood, Dr. Rosenberg developed a keen interest in new forms of communication that would provide peaceful alternatives to the violence he encountered. His interest led to a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of Wisconsin in 1961, where he studied under Carl Rogers. His subsequent life experience and study of comparative religion motivated him to develop the Nonviolent Communication (NVC) process.
  > 
  > Dr. Rosenberg first used the NVC process in federally funded school integration projects to provide mediation and communication skills training during the 1960s. The Center for Nonviolent Communication, which he founded in 1984, now has hundreds of certified NVC trainers and supporters teaching NVC in more than 35 countries around the globe.

* [Basics of Nonviolent Communication](https://baynvc.org/basics-of-nonviolent-communication/)
  > Learning NVC is a process similar to learning a new language or skill: step-by-step learning coupled with ample time for practice lead to growing mastery. While it takes time to develop fluency, any knowledge of a new language makes it more likely that communication can take place. In addition, because NVC invites us to a level of vulnerability and caring that often are not familiar or habitual, full integration of the consciousness underlying this language is likely to require changes in our internal connection to ourselves, and healing of past pain.

#### Chapter 1 - NVC: Language of Life

[Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/book-chapter-1)

> NVC is founded on language and communication skills that strengthen our ability to remain human, even under trying conditions. It contains nothing new; all that has been integrated into NVC has been known for centuries. The intent is to remind us about what we already know—about how we humans were meant to relate to one another—and to assist us in living in a way that concretely manifests this knowledge.
> 
> NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and hear others. Instead of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious responses based firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting. We are led to express ourselves with honesty and clarity, while simultaneously paying others a respectful and empathic attention. In any exchange, we come to hear our own deeper needs and those of others. NVC trains us to observe carefully, and to be able to specify behaviors and conditions that are affecting us. We learn to identify and clearly articulate what we are concretely wanting in any given situation. The form is simple, yet powerfully transformative.

## NVC Model

### 4 Steps

* [The Practice of NonViolent Communication](http://www.citizenshandbook.org/nonviolent_communication.pdf)

> Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a simple method for clear, empathic communication consisting of four steps: Stating observations, then feelings, then needs, then requests. NVC aims to find a way for all present to get what really matters to them without the use of guilt, humiliation, shame. It is useful for resolving conflicts, connecting with others, and living in a way that is conscious, present, and attuned to the genuine, living needs of yourself and others

* [4 Part NVC Process - PDF](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/pdf_files/4part_nvc_process.pdf)

#### 1. Observations

State the observations that are leading you to feel the need to say something. These should be purely factual observations, with no component of judgment or evaluation. 

#### 2. Feelings

State the feeling that the observation is triggering in you. Or, guess what the other person is feeling, and ask. Naming the emotion, without moral judgment, enables you to connect in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation. Perform this step with the aim of accurately identifying the feeling that you or the other person are experiencing in that moment, not with the aim of shaming them for their feeling or otherwise trying to prevent them from feeling as they do.

#### 3. Needs

State the need that is the cause of that feeling. Or, guess the need that caused the feeling in the other person, and ask. When our needs are met, we have happy, positive feelings; when they are not met, we have negative feelings. By tuning into the feeling, you can often find the underlying need. Stating the need, without morally judging it, gives you both clarity about what is alive in you or the other person in that moment.

#### 4. Requests

Make a concrete request for action to meet the need just identified. Ask clearly and specifically for what you want right now, rather than hinting or stating only what you don't want.

## Human Needs and Human-scale Development

* [Universal Human Needs](https://baynvc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Universal-Human-Needs.jpg)
* [cnvc - Needs Inventory](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory) 
* [Max-Neef Model of Human-Scale Development](http://www.rainforestinfo.org.au/background/maxneef.htm) - [p2pfoundation wiki](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Max-Neef_Model_of_Human-Scale_Development)
  > Max-Neef classifies the fundamental human needs as: **subsistence**, **protection**, **affection**, **understanding**, **participation**, **recreation** (in the sense of leisure, time to reflect, or idleness), **creation**, **identity and freedom**. Needs are also defined according to the existential categories of being, having, doing and interacting, and from these dimensions, a 36 cell matrix is developed which can be filled with examples of satisfiers for those needs.

| **Fundamental Human Needs** | **Being (qualities)** | **Having (things)** | **Doing (actions)** | **Interacting (settings)** |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Subsistence** | physical and mental health | food, shelter work | feed, clothe, rest, work | living environment, social setting |
| **Protection** | care, adaptability, autonomy | social security, health systems, work | co-operate, plan, take care of, help | social environment, dwelling  |
| **Affection** | respect, sense of humour, generosity, sensuality | friendships, family, relationships with nature | share, take care of, make love, express emotions | privacy, intimate spaces of togetherness | 
| **Understanding** | critical capacity, curiosity, intuition | literature, teachers, policies | educational | analyse, study, meditate, investigate | schools, families universities, communities | 
| **Participation** | receptiveness, dedication, sense of humour | responsibilities, duties, work, rights | cooperate, dissent, express opinions | associations, parties, churches, neighbourhoods |
| **Leisure** | imagination, tranquillity, spontaneity | games, parties, peace of mind | day-dream, remember, relax, have fun | landscapes, intimate spaces, places to be alone |
| **Creation** | imagination, boldness, inventiveness, curiosity | abilities, skills, work, techniques | invent, build, design, work, compose, interpret | spaces for expression, workshops, audiences | 
| **Identity** | sense of belonging, self-esteem, consistency | language, religions, work, customs, values, norms | get to know oneself, grow, commit oneself | places one | belongs to, everyday settings |
| **Freedom** | autonomy, passion, self-esteem, open-mindedness | equal rights | dissent, choose, run risks, develop awareness | anywhere |

> Satisfiers also have different characteristics: they can be violators or destroyers, pseudosatisfiers, inhibiting satisfiers, singular satisfiers, or synergic satisfiers. Max-Neef shows that certain satisfiers, promoted as satisfying a particular need, in fact inhibit or destroy the possibility of satisfying other needs: eg, the arms race, while ostensibly satisfying the need for protection, in fact then destroys subsistence, participation, affection and freedom; formal democracy, which is supposed to meet the need for participation often disempowers and alienates; commercial television, while used to satisfy the need for recreation, interferes with understanding, creativity and identity - the examples are everywhere.
> 
> Synergic satisfiers, on the other hand, not only satisfy one particular need, but also lead to satisfaction in other areas: some examples are breast-feeding; self-managed production; popular education; democratic community organisations; preventative medicine; meditation; educational games.


## Jakal and Giraffe Language

* [Compassionate Communication by Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D.](https://www.naturalchild.org/articles/marshall_rosenberg/compassionate_communication.html)
  > At an early age, most of us were taught to speak and think Jackal. This language is from the head. It is a way of mentally classifying people into varying shades of good and bad, right and wrong. Ultimately it provokes defensiveness, resistance and counterattack. Giraffe bids us to speak from the heart, to talk about what is going on for us - without judging others. In this idiom, you give people an opportunity to say yes, although you respect no for an answer. Giraffe is a language of requests; Jackal is a language of demands.

![](https://giraffeincblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/jakal-giraffe1.jpg)

* [Giraffe Language: Changing Learned Communication Patterns](https://giraffeincblog.com/2011/02/25/jackal-and-giraffe-language/)
  > Giraffe Language is interpersonal communication divided into two fundamental genres: “jackal” and “giraffe.” From infancy our culture teaches us to speak “jackal,” a language of demands that provoke defensiveness, resistance and counterattack. “giraffe,” on the other hand, is the language of requests that allows us to communicate with others in respectful, compassionate ways. Why giraffe? Because giraffes have the largest hearts of all land animals (up to 40 lbs!). Jackals, due to their low proximity to the ground, tend to see just what’s under their noses. Jackal language symbolizes short-sighted, self-protecting, limited communication.
* [Non-violent communication: are you a jackal or a giraffe?](https://arielfreespirit.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/non-violent-communication-are-you-a-jackal-or-a-giraffe/)
  > I’ve recently watched a quite lengthy but fun presentation by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg on non-violent communication. I highly recommend it: that man’s a stand-up comedian. Rosenberg coined the terms giraffe and jackal language in interpersonal communication, where the former is the language of the heart, the giraffe being the animal with the largest heart (up to 40 lbs), while the latter is a language of criticism and demands that only triggers counterattack and defensiveness. He describes an easy six-step approach to having productive communication as a giraffe in conflictual situations that I’ll try to do justice to.
* [“GIRAFFE LANGUAGE” AND “JACKAL LANGUAGE”: A STUDY OF TWO OPPOSITE COMMUNICATION RITUALS](http://journalarticle.ukm.my/5338/1/V28_1_1-16.pdf) - Jurnal Komunikasi Malaysian Journal of Communication 
  > This paper refers to the “giraffe language” and “jackal language”, which allude to the “non-violent communication” concept according to Marshall B. Rosenberg. The two languages being discussed describe two different types of rhetoric and, at the same time, two opposite communication/social rituals used by people in their everyday life and also in the mass media, and omnipresent in the advertisement. The paper tries to draw attention that contemporary media is based on “jackal language” (often strongly rooted in our culture and mentality) being a language of violence, blocking empathy and stimulating conflicts and tension in interpersonal communication and relationships). Unfortunately media makes a tremendous impact on the customers (especially on young people).This paper aims to propagate and encourage using the “giraffe language” described as the language of love, understanding and clemency. The ‘giraffe language’ encourages constructive, matter-of-fact and unbiased communication. A long giraffe’s neck became its symbol - a metaphor of perfect (objectivity) communication.

  > Emotional competency is an important skill that can provide several benefits throughout many aspects of your life. It can increase the satisfaction you have with relationships while it increases your gratification and contentment with the many simple events in your life. It can give you greater insight and help you better understand the motives and actions of yourself and others. You can free yourself from anger, hate, resentment, vengeance, and other destructive emotions that cause hurt and pain. You can feel relief and enjoy greater peace-of-mind, autonomy, intimacy, dignity, competence, and wisdom as you engage more deeply with others. Increasing your tolerance and compassion can lead to an authentic optimism and a well-founded confidence, based on your better understanding and interpretation of what-is.

#### Non-Defensive Communication

* [The Institute for Powerful Non-Defensive Communication](https://pndc.com)

We want to do everything in our power to offer support to our community of friends and website visitors. Our family hopes that what we're offering on our website and through our products will add to your skills in speaking with both honesty and compassion with coworkers, friends, and family.
* [NONVIOLENT AND NON-DEFENSIVE COMMUNICATION](https://www.alternativeresolutions.net/2017/06/01/nonviolent-and-non-defensive-communication/)
  > Another theorist in this arena, Sharon Strand Ellison, the director of the Institute for Powerful Non-Defensive Communication (NDC), expresses some of the same ideas as Marshall. Ellison’s view is that most of our current communication structure reinforces prejudice and stereotypes and assumes that “the other” in any communication is the enemy.  As she started doing research into the definitions of some basic communication terms, she discovered that there are a lot of war analogies used. Ms. Ellison shows that people make rampant use of predications, statements, and questions to attack, blame, sabotage, and justify in our communications with others.
