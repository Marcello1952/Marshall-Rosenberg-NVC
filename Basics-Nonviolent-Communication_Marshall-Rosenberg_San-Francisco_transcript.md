## Part 1: 

#### The Purpose of Nonviolent Communication & Expressing Observations and Feelings

First let me begin by clarifying the purpose of Nonviolent Communication. Its purpose is to help you to do what you already know how to do. Now why do we need to learn something today that you already know how to do? Because sometimes we forget to do this. We forget because we've been educated to forget.

Now what is it that i'm talking about that we already know how to do? **The purpose of this process is to help us to connect in a way that makes natural giving possible.**

01:01
what do i mean by natural giving let me do you a song to make it clear
01:07
what i mean by natural giving i never feel more given to than when you take
01:27
from me when you understand the joy i feel caring
01:37
for you and you know my giving isn't done to put you
01:45
in my debt but because i want to live the love i feel
01:52
for you to receive with grace may be the greatest
02:01
giving there's no way that i can separate the two
02:12
when you give to me I give you my receiving and when you take from me
02:25
i feel so given to you all know that giving
02:35
you know how to do it and that's what i'm interested in
02:40
by remembering to stay with that quality of giving
02:45
moment by moment in any connection but we also all know that it's easy to lose
02:50
it it's easy to lose that connection
02:54
so that instead of enjoying that quality of giving
02:58
which is possible every moment in every contact we have
03:01
in spite of how precious that is we forget and instead of playing the game that that
03:09
song is about which i call making life wonderful for us
03:13
it's the most fun game i've ever heard instead much of the time we play another game
03:21
called who's right have you ever played that game?
03:31
it's a game where everybody loses so isn't this amazing
03:34
that we all know about this quality of giving that this song is about
03:40
it's possible every moment we find that the richest thing to do
03:48
and much of our right we end up playing who's right
03:52
now the game of who's right involves two of the most devious things human beings
03:58
have ever come upon one - punishment
04:02
see cause if you're wrong in the game of who's right you deserve to suffer
04:08
can you imagine a more diabolical concept to educate people
04:14
so if you haven't already abstained from punishment i'm sure by the end of the day that will no
04:20
longer be a part of your consciousness no more punishment
04:23
we won't do it in your families we'll get rid of it with criminals
04:27
it just makes things more violent we'll find other ways to deal with other nations
04:32
beside punishment no more punishment
04:38
no more reward it's the same game
04:40
see it's part of the game of who's right you're right than you get rewarded
04:47
wrong you get punished no more
04:49
no more it's created enough violence on the planet
04:56
no more guilt induction see no more shame
05:04
no more concepts of duty and obligation just what the song is about
05:09
natural giving so how did we get off target
05:16
we get off target according to walter wink theologian who writes in his book "The powers
05:23
that be" we got off target about 5000 years ago
05:26
we lost we got off target because we started to get some wild thinking
05:34
wild thinking that human beings are innately evil
05:41
when you believe that human beings are innately evil than the things aren't going as we would
05:46
like what's the corrective process the corrective process is penitence see
05:54
the people are evil you think that the way to bring about change when people are behaving
05:59
in the way you don't like is to make people hate themselves for what
06:03
they did so for these political reasons and theological
06:08
reasons we started to develop a language that i call jackal language
06:14
language that cuts us off from life and
06:20
makes it very easy to do to be violent very easy to be violent
06:24
in fact in that book i mentioned wink says that domination cultures
06:31
one of the things you have to educate people is to make violence enjoyable see
06:37
and we've done a good job with that we make violence enjoyable in our culture
06:42
two hours a night from seven to nine when children are watching the television the most
06:46
in 75% of the programs they watch the hero kills somebody or beats them up you see
06:53
so we and when does this happen at the climax of
06:56
the program we've been educated for quite a while to make
07:01
violence enjoyable so even thought i think what that song was
07:05
about is what is really closer to our nature this natural giving
07:10
we've been educated to make violence enjoyable and educated in a way we can even be violent
07:17
to our children so what is jackal language like?
07:22
see jackal language i've mentioned is language of moralistic judgment
07:28
you think in terms of who's right who's wrong who's bad
07:36
and when you mention change yes we want change at times so how you get change in the jackal
07:42
system watch a parent tryin' to bring about change
07:45
in the child this is the parent teaching a young child
07:48
say one of the most important words in jackal say you're sorry
07:55
i'm sowy you're not really sorry i can see it you're
08:00
not really sorry i'm sorry
08:05
okay i forgive you can you imagine a game like that?
08:12
can you imagine a parent responding to a child that way?
08:15
and if a parent is gonna do that to a child in their own family what are they gonna do
08:20
to people from other cultures who behave in a way they don't appreciate
08:25
so of course you're gonna have violence wherever you've got this kind of thinking
08:30
in cultures that do not have this thinking you don't see violence you see
08:35
so that's how we got off target
08:38
even though we could be playing the game make life wonderful each moment
08:43
we have been educated for quiet a while to play another game - who's right
08:49
so what are the parts of this game of who's right
08:51
i've just mentioned one of them one part is moralistic judgment
08:56
learning how to go up to our head and think basically in terms of right and wrong
09:01
good and bad normal abnormal
09:05
i learned this game very well i speak several dialects of jackal
09:12
i grew up speak - i grew up in detroit we spoke a rather harsh dialect of jackal
09:18
we might call it detroit jackal for example if i'm out driving
09:25
and someone is driving in the way that i don't like
09:27
and again i want to install change you see i roll down the window
09:32
idiot! now theoretically the person is supposed to repent
09:38
see i confess i was wrong sir i will change the
09:46
error of my ways it's a great theory it didn't work
09:54
i've tried it more than once it doesn't work so i thought maybe it was because that particular
09:59
dialect of jackal so i decided to get a more cultured use of
10:04
jackal so i went to the university and got a doctor's degree in professional jackal
10:11
now when somebody's driving in a way i don't like i roll down the window
10:15
psychopath! still doesn't work
10:22
you see there's another part of this language of jackal
10:28
amtsprache amtsprache that's very important you see a
10:35
language that denies choice denies the responsibility for our actions
10:41
i use the word amtsprache for this part having read an interview with the nazi war criminal
10:49
adolf eichmann at his trial for war crimes in jerusalem
10:55
eichmann was asked: was it hard to send tens of thousands of people to their death?
11:01
and eichmann answered, candidly he said: to tell you the truth, it was easy. our language
11:08
made it easy. that interview shocked that that answer shocked
11:13
his interviewer and his interviewer said: what language?
11:18
eichmann said: in fact my fellow nazi officers and i we had our own name for our language.
11:24
we called it amtsprache. amt in german means office and sprache language
11:30
i'd call that bureaucratic language he was asked for some examples
11:36
eichmann said: it's a language in which you deny responsibility for your
11:43
your actions so if somebody asks you why you did it you
11:47
say: I had to. then you don't feel so bad, if you "have to"
11:51
do it, you see, and not be responsible but why did you "have to", jackal? - superior's
11:57
orders. company policy. they made me do it. i couldn't
12:04
do elsewhat. very dangerous language, amtsprache.
12:09
very dangerous. we had giraffe schools - i use the word giraffe
12:15
you see, it's a symbol for non-violence. we'll see today that the language we're gonna
12:21
study is the language of the heart and so i use giraffe language for that because
12:27
giraffes have the largest heart of any land animal so
12:29
uhm giraffe requires
12:39
always being conscious of choice you see we never do anything that we don't choose
12:44
to do but i was teaching giraffe to a group of parents
12:50
and teachers in one community and we have giraffe schools throughout the world
12:55
we have five in israel, four in palestine some in serbia, and so forth
13:02
and in giraffe schools of course we wanna make sure that certainly that the teachers
13:06
and parents never use amtsprache one of the most dangerous languages in the
13:12
world to teach a child you have to do something
13:17
so i was saying this one time in st louis, missouri, to a group of parents and teachers
13:22
and a mother got very upset, she said: but there are some things you have to do, whether
13:26
you like to do it or not it's our job as parents to teach our children
13:30
what they have to do i mean there's thing i do every day that i
13:33
hate to do but there just are some things you have to do
13:37
whoa, I said, can you give me any example she said: well, easy, there's so many.
13:43
let me think okay, like when i leave here tonight
13:47
i have to go home and cook i hate to cook
13:50
i hate it with a passion but i've done it every day for twenty years
13:56
even when i've been sick well, i said, i'll be very happy today to
14:02
show you another way of thinking another language that i hope would open up
14:06
happier possibilities for you well i'm pleased to report she was a rapid
14:12
giraffe student she went home that very evening and announced
14:16
to her family that she no longer wanted to cook
14:22
i got some feedback from her family feedback came two weeks later when i swung
14:31
through that city again and was doing an evening workshop
14:35
and who shows up but her two older sons she had four sons
14:40
they came up at the beginning to introduce themselves
14:44
I said: hey I'm glad you guys came up here I've been very curious what's going on in
14:48
your family your mother's been calling me regularly telling
14:51
me about all the changes she made in her life since the training
14:57
like what happened that first night when she came home and announced that she no longer
15:00
wanted to cook? the oldest son said to me:
15:04
marshall, i said to myself, thank go i said: help me understand that one
15:20
you see i said to myself, now maybe she won't complain at every meal you see
15:26
you see natural giving -what i started the day off, with that song-
15:29
anything we do in life that isn't coming out of that energy we pay for it and everybody
15:34
else pays for it anything we do out of fear of punishment if
15:39
we don't - everybody pays for it anything we do for a reward - everybody pays
15:45
for it everything we do to make people like us - everybody
15:49
pays for it everything we do out of guilt, shame, duty,
15:54
obligation - everybody pays for it that isn't what we were designed for
15:59
we were designed to enjoy giving to give from the heart
16:03
um, marshall, i'm over here - my son brought me to one of your seminars and i met you some
16:14
ten years ago yes
16:16
in oakland yes
16:17
now i'm tryna bring my son back i'm here and he said last night when i told
16:25
him i was coming here he said - why don't you go and have a couple
16:28
of appointments uh maybe you could teach me something
16:33
so i thought i would come to learn something maybe i could teach him
16:38
what i'd like to teach him - and i don't know how to do that - i'd like to teach him to
16:42
at least give me the time of day to communicate with him
16:46
he doesn't do that willingly when i try to demand it
16:50
it make things come worse so how do it do that?
16:56
well, that would be a good situation to work on today cause i'm gonna ask everyone to think
17:01
of a situation right now when somebody's behaving in a way you don't
17:05
like so in this case it's your son
17:06
when you ask him to communicate he says no the first thing i suggest is you can't teach
17:13
anybody anything and to have that as an objective is itself
17:17
creating problems so let's change the objective
17:23
let's never try to teach anybody anything or to change anybody
17:26
if that's your objective you'll create resistance so that'll be my first suggestion today
17:34
never try to teach anybody anything or to change anybody
17:40
that clear? yup. okay so what you do then, give up?
17:44
oh no, no. see this is, this is the thinking that's been shaped in us by jackal
17:50
see the game of who's right - win-lose. so that if we can't change and win than the option
17:57
we think of is to be a chump and lose you see
18:01
we've been educated to think in those two ways: win lose. right wrong
18:05
no, i'll show you a way. another option. okay, let's get into it. let's give you a
18:12
chance to practice it some of you have already thought of situations
18:16
such as somebody you want very much to communicate with they say no
18:20
so think of somebody at the moment who is behaving in a way that is not making life
18:26
wonderful for you and you'd like to get to the place that the song was about
18:32
where everybody's needs can get met and people are giving to one another from
18:37
the heart, willingly not out of coercion, you see
18:41
let's see if we can show you a process to get there in this situation
18:44
to get everybody's needs met and where people give willingly, not out of
18:50
any coercion so maybe you are living at home
18:54
maybe you choose today to work on a child that you're living with at home
18:58
who says horrible horrible jackal things such as
19:01
no you laugh - you try living with one for a
19:08
while please brush your teeth - no
19:14
maybe you are living at home with a jackal-speaking partner
19:18
who says horrible jackal things such as: that hurts me when you say that
19:26
we'll see today that it's a violent act, to say others make you feel as you do
19:32
to imply that others can make you feel hurt, or angry
19:39
maybe at work somebody's behaving in a way you don't like
19:42
they come late they're not producing as well as you would
19:45
like maybe your next door neighbour has been sexually
19:50
molesting children - whoever you wanna pick somebody who's behaving in a way you don't
19:53
like and you'd like to see how we would arrive
19:58
at the objective of creating the quality of connection
20:02
that will get everybody's needs met through natural giving
20:06
that's our objective okay?
20:08
now, open up your materials to the last page, second to the last page, at
20:18
the top it says expressing how we are and what we would like
20:34
and it says under a: think of someone who does something that makes life something less
20:39
than wonderful for you so there's person whom i'm asking you to think
20:44
about who's presently behaving in a way you're not crazy about
20:48
and what i'd like you to do is answer this question, right here:
20:53
one thing that the person does that you don't like
20:55
we're gonna work on one specific action that the person does that you don't like
21:01
to get you familiar with the process today maybe the person does several things, but
21:06
we're gonna show you how the process works by showing you how to communicate with the
21:11
person about one specific thing they did
21:15
so write under A) one specific thing person does that you don't like
21:23
now when I was here in San Francisco working with the school system back in the seventies
21:29
the superintendent in this school asked me to go into an elementary school
21:34
he said: the parents are complaining about the quality of relationship between these
21:39
teachers and the administrator they said the tension in the school is so
21:44
great that the parents want to take their children out of the school
21:49
so he asked if I would go in see if I could open up better communication between the staff
21:54
and the administrator the plan was I would meet first with the teachers
22:00
and then get the teachers and the administrator together
22:02
so in my meeting with the teachers i started with the question that i just asked you
22:07
i asked the teachers: can you tell me one thing that the administrator does, that makes
22:14
it hard for you to work with him? I was asking for an observation
22:19
a concrete behavior what is one thing he does
22:23
the first teacher to respond said: he has a big mouth.
22:30
now can you see the difference between the question I ask
22:35
and the answer I got? I did not ask: what size mouth does the principal
22:43
have? so this teacher was giving me an evalution
22:47
an analysis that implies wrongness you see we've been so trained to think that
22:53
way that sometimes we can't separate fact and
22:57
opinion what we always see is our enemy image
23:00
whether it's an individual or a nation we have been trained to think in enemy images
23:09
wrongness it obscures reality
23:14
we don't see the behavior, we just see our enemy image
23:19
in his book "Out of weakness" Andrew Schmookler says
23:23
that when cultures are taught to think this way
23:27
not to just see the person but an image
23:30
a judgment they've made bombs are never far away you see
23:38
so i pointed this out to the gentleman that this was not an answer to my question
23:43
i wanted to know one thing that principal did
23:47
this man was stuck, he just couldn't get it the woman sitting next to him tried to help
23:53
she says: well I know what he's referring to
23:54
i said: ok, help him out what's one thing that the principal does?
23:58
he talks too much no, too much is a judgment
24:04
i asked for an observation not a judgment
24:07
see this is how jackal-speaking people think they really had been brought up to think there
24:12
is such a thing as a just right amount of everything
24:18
and too much, and too little and that they know what it is
24:21
you see - they think that way doesn't make resolving conflict too easy with
24:27
them people have an idea that there's a right and
24:30
a too much and a too little and they know what it is
24:34
and especially when they mix it up with an observation
24:36
I was just asking what does the person do and again for the second time this person
24:41
couldn't see the behavior separate from the judgment
24:46
a third person tried to help well i know what they're talking about
24:49
okay, what? he thinks he's the only one that has anything
24:52
worth saying no, telling me what you think he thinks is
24:58
an evaluation you're making of what you think is going on in his head
25:03
i was asking for what does he do a fourth woman said: he wants to be the center
25:09
of attention all the time i said: now you're giving me a judgment or
25:13
a diagnosis of his motives even if it's accurate, it's a diagnosis of
25:17
his motives it's not an observable behavior
25:20
my question was: what does he do? now the entire faculty sits there quiet
25:27
nobody can answer the question and one of the women said to me: boy, marshall,
25:32
that's hard to do yes, in fact the philosopher Krishnamurti
25:38
says that to observe without evaluating is the highest
25:43
form of human intelligence so those of us who had been taught to think
25:50
in these enemy images immediately to think - right, wrong, bad,
25:54
normal, abnormal, appropriate, inappropriate, too this, too that -
26:00
we can't see reality all we see is our enemy images
26:07
well with great effort on my part I finally got them to get rid of the images
26:12
and answer this simple question: what does he do?
26:16
there was several things, but the one that they wanted particularly to start working
26:20
with him on was this: that during their once a week faculty meetings,
26:25
regardless of what was on the agenda, he would relate it to a war experience or
26:30
a childhood experience and the average meeting lasted twenty minutes
26:34
longer than it was scheduled okay - that answered my question of what he
26:38
did he talked about war experiences, childhood
26:42
experiences rather than sticking to the agenda
26:45
i said: have you called that to his attention? they said: well, we can see now that when
26:50
we try to talk to him about it these other judgments get mixed in and he gets defensive
26:55
so they thought it would be a good idea to talk to him about it
26:58
but they asked if i would be at the meeting, just in case
27:03
so i attended their next staff meeting and i saw rather quickly what they were talking
27:07
about because almost as soon as an issue came up
27:10
the principal would say - oh that reminds me of a time, and he would start to tell a
27:15
story and i was waiting for somebody to confront
27:19
him on this, in giraffe but instead of that, there was a lot of nonverbal
27:24
jackaling going on people were going like this: rolling their
27:28
eyes poking the person next to them
27:34
yawning looking at their watches
27:38
holding the watches up to the ear and i watched this scenario going on for a
27:48
while and i said: excuse me, but isn't somebody
27:51
gonna say something now there's a silence and a man who spoke
27:56
up in our first meeting i could just see him getting his courage up
28:00
and he looks at the principal and says: ed, you have a big mouth
28:03
so, let's see if whether what you wrote down answered the question i asked
28:11
is it an observable behavior or did you mixed in any evaluation?
28:15
and my two friends here will help us to make this evaluation
28:18
um this animal has been taught to somewhat like a police dog to sniff out narcotics
28:25
if there's any jackal mixed in, he will howl if you answered the question, this animal
28:30
will dance my dad blames my wife for my choices
28:40
he does what? - he blames my wife for my choices. yeah. "blames" is a judgment
28:49
that's already putting evaluation into it dad, do you see yourself as blaming her? - no,
28:55
i see myself as calling attention to the facts so, see, dad doesn't see that as blaming - no,
29:03
I'm educating thank you, dad, yes, okay
29:05
so how do we say... see, we need a direct quote
29:09
we need to give... to make it an observable behavior, we need to say: my father says...
29:15
what? all of his problems. - you are responsible
29:20
for all of his problems? he says this to the wife: you are responsible
29:26
for all of his problems. that's it. yes, that's a direct quote.
29:31
that's what he says. that's giraffe language, a direct quote, okay?
29:35
see, as soon as you see... have the world "blame" in your consciousness
29:42
it's gonna change the whole energy with which you approach the person
29:45
cause you're basically making a judgment of them is blaming
29:48
which everybody knows is wrong yes? - i have the mike
29:53
lately my son is not doing his history homework mhm, okay.
30:04
my dad makes harsh judgments and insulting remarks.
30:09
omg you killed my poor jackal. he could have handled the harsh, that was
30:26
one judgment, but insulting - harsh and insulting - those are two judgments
30:32
I - he does use insulting words no, there is no such thing - after today,
30:37
in fact, seriously, by 4:30 this afternoon, you will never hear another insult
30:42
it won't exist insults will not exist
30:45
i'm gonna show you to use some technology today that takes insults and criticism out
30:51
of the way so that no matter what your father says, you
30:58
can never hear another harsh statement or another insult
31:02
cause we're gonna show you today to use this technology
31:05
and with this technology it will be impossible for you to hear criticism
31:19
harsh remarks insults
31:23
with these ears - all you can hear is the only thing
31:27
human beings are ever saying - please, and thank you
31:31
see that's all we're gonna show you today that all that used
31:37
to sound like criticism, judgments, blame are simply tragic suicidal expressions of
31:44
"please" my brother yells at me to get in the car to
31:52
go to school and then he makes me late to school
31:55
who yells? but you see, "yells" is a kind of a bit of
32:03
an evaluation now he, he speaks in a tone of voice
32:07
yes okay, it's a tone of voice
32:10
i was asked at lincoln high school lincoln high school in san francisco?
32:15
many years ago i was asked to work with the faculty there
32:17
they were having a whole lotta tension amongst the faculty racially, ethnically
32:21
there was a lot of tension superintendent asked me to work there and
32:26
i started the day asking: tell me something that somebody else on the
32:30
faculty does that you don't like man turns to the woman next to him and says:
32:35
i don't like it when you yell at our faculty meetings
32:38
she says: WHO YELLS?? now she was from a different culture than
32:46
this man see what was yelling in her culture was quite
32:49
different and about ten minutes later when she's started
32:52
to yell at him by her own definition I saw a difference you know I
32:56
so he raises the voice when he's asking you to get ready for school yes
33:03
just kinda gets angry at me gets angry, that's ... may be accurate, but
33:07
it's a diagnosis we don't know whether his angry
33:09
he might be scared that you're gonna miss school
33:12
it might sound to you like angry, maybe it is, maybe it isn't
33:15
but - raises the voice, has smoke coming out of his ears
33:20
that you can see that's observable
33:22
yes? - fifth grader jessie refuses to do his seatwork
33:31
refuses is a diagnosis it may be an accurate diagnosis
33:38
but it doesn't tell me what he does he says: no, i don't wanna do it
33:42
he says no, i don't wanna do it. that's the behavior
33:53
my husband doesn't tell me things which will affect me deeply
33:56
okay - that's the first jackal husband i've ever heard of
34:03
this is a new experience for me today student in my class incessantly talks loud,
34:15
won't stay seated, won't keep his hands to himself
34:17
i hear about three judgments in there let's go over it slowly, cause i hear three
34:21
diagnosis say it again
34:23
so we'll hear the three diagnosis incessantly talks loud
34:28
loud is uh your interpretation louder than you would like - if you wanna
34:31
say it, put it that way, louder than i would like
34:35
won't stay seated - won't is a diagnosis doesn't stay in his seat after i've told him
34:41
to he might in the future, we don't know whether
34:42
he will or not i say that's a diagnosis
34:44
doesn't, at the moment, doesn't when i ask him to stay in his seat
34:51
and does not keep his hands to himself ok, since coming to the introductory presentation
34:59
on Tuesday night, I've been very aware of hearing evaluations
35:03
yes - in myself, and especially in other people and so i started to wander - you know, are
35:09
all of those violent communications, or would there be a way that some of those
35:14
are, according to this model, non-violent? i would say that any evaluation of others
35:20
that implies wrongness is a tragic expression of an unmet need
35:30
tragic in the sense for two reasons first - it decreases the likelihood that we
35:35
will get what we want even if we don't say it out loud
35:39
even if we think it if we are even thinking that what somebody
35:42
else does is wrong it decreases the likelihood that we will get
35:46
what we want and second, it increases the likelihood of
35:52
violence so, what could be more tragic than that?
35:55
than expressing ourself in a way that gets in the way in our getting what we want
36:00
and increases violence anything that we want to say that implies
36:05
wrongness on the part of the other person I'm suggesting is a tragic suicidal expression
36:11
of an unmet need say the need
36:15
learn a need consciousness which is what we'll gonna get to now you see
36:19
that's how we evaluate in non-violent communication we evaluate from the heart
36:26
we make judgments, but we make needs serving judgments
36:31
we judge whether what people are doing is meeting needs or not
36:36
we don't moralistically judge the person for what they did
36:40
we judge whether it's serving life or not because needs are our direct connection with
36:44
life they're the life that's goin'...
36:47
needs are the life that's seeking expression within us
36:52
so we evaluate with reference to that and that requires two kinds of literacy
36:58
feelings, and needs. so let's be sure we are all speaking the same
37:03
language when i use the term "feelings and needs"
37:08
so under b), it says imagine that you are talking directly to the person
37:15
and express how you feel when the person acts in the way described above
37:20
and use this form - again, we're talking to the other person
37:25
we're telling them now what they did and we say
37:27
when you do this, I feel ... how? how do you feel, when the person does what
37:36
you wrote down under a)? write that down
37:46
when you do this i feel angry - okay anger is a feeling, created by unnatural thinking
37:54
we get to that next when you're not ready to leave at the agreed
38:02
time i feel anxious and impatient when you speak that loud, i feel intimidated
38:14
intimidated is a diagnosis. be careful of words that are more descriptions
38:18
of other people what you think they're doing to you, like
38:21
intimidating you so
38:24
write down the following as *not* feeling words
38:27
do not mistake these words as feelings i feel misunderstood
38:33
i feel used i feel manipulated
38:37
i feel judged i feel criticised
38:41
i feel ignored for example, aren't there times when you think
38:45
somebody's ignoring you - don't you feel relieved? and at other times don't you feel angry?
38:55
you see, words like that really say very little about what's alive in you
39:00
they say much more how you are interpreting the other person's behavior
39:04
and above all, never mistake the word "rejected" as a feeling
39:07
i feel "rejected" - no. that's not a feeling, it's a suicidal interpretation
39:12
okay, who's got the mike? there's the mike
39:17
hurt, disappointed, disenhearted feel angry and betrayed
39:30
angry, yes - AHOOO for betrayed betrayed is one of those words like intimidated,
39:35
ignored, misinterpreted, used, manipulated it's more a diagnosis of the other person
39:41
than a feeling what about, what about contracted?
39:47
contracted? - if you mean tense, or like that okay, if it's that.
39:56
when you call me up and speaking loudly tell me you are going to cut off funding
40:01
i feel angry and scared uhm
40:09
when you leave the dishes in the sink i feel powerless over my environment
40:12
in time which feels frustrating and scary when you start talking loudly in the middle
40:21
of my sentence i feel hurt because i think you are not listening
40:26
to me now the feeling is great, but you're gonna
40:29
lose it if you follow the word feel with the word "because I think"
40:33
anytime you're thinking you're chance of getting what you need is
40:36
greatly decreased especially if you follow the word "think"
40:43
with the word "you" than I think you not only won't get hurt,
40:46
I predict the defensive aggressive reaction
40:49
so, it's gonna be hard for people to care about your feelings
40:55
when you follow that with a diagnosis that implies wrongness
41:00
we'll get to that next, cause we're gonna see next
41:02
that we - after the feelings there's two places we don't go
41:08
in one is up to our head see, we stay in the heart with feelings
41:13
we don't go up to the head we stay in the heart and connect with needs
41:17
but we'll get to that yeah
41:19
if we want to use non-violent communication we want to be sure that we not use the feeling
41:26
in a violent way because feelings can either connect us at
41:31
the heart, or they can contribute to more division and violence
41:36
so, we certainly do not want to ever express our feelings in this way:
41:44
I feel as I do because you... okay?
41:50
we never want to express our feelings this way
41:52
you make me feel now that would be a hard habit to get away
41:58
from because
42:00
in a jackal culture feelings are very instrumental to using guilt
42:05
as a way of manipulating people the way to manipulate people is if you can
42:10
convince them that they make you feel as you do
42:14
than they should feel guilty and change you see
42:17
so it's another form of this violent game so for example if you are a parent and you
42:24
wanna use feelings in a violent way rather than a connecting way
42:28
you would express it this way: it really hurts me when you don't clean up
42:32
your room okay?
42:37
or: you make me angry when you say that! i was talking during the break about one of
42:48
my happiest days as a parent twas when my oldest son went to the jackal
42:55
school for the first time he had gone six years to a giraffe school
43:00
that I'd help create but then he was... I wanted him to learn how
43:06
to enjoy jackals as well so and in giraffe schools we also want to be
43:13
aware are not always gonna be in this settings so we want them to learn how to stay with
43:19
their own values regardless of which structure they're in
43:23
so he comes back the first day from school and he looked less than happy
43:27
and i said: how was your new school, rick? and he said: it's okay dad, but ugh-boy, some
43:34
of those teachers, dad i said: what happened?
43:37
he said: dad i wasn't even in the front door, really I was halfway through the front door
43:42
and some man teacher comes running over and says:
43:45
my, my, look at the little girl can you guess what the teacher was reacting
43:52
to? yeah, my son's hair was down to his shoulders
43:56
see, in a jackal school, as we all know authority knows what's right
44:00
see there's a right way to wear your hair as a boy, and a wrong way
44:03
a right way to do everything, and who knows - the teacher
44:08
and then what do you do if someone doesn't do it?
44:10
you use shame, guilt, and so forth you use "girl" as though as an insult
44:15
welcome to jackal land so i'm getting burned up ready to go do little
44:21
BAT (behavior adjustment training) therapy with the teacher
44:26
forgetting all about my teachings and i said to my son:
44:31
how did you handle it? he said: i remembered dad that, what you said,
44:35
that when you're in that kind of environment never give them the power to make you submit
44:41
or rebel one of the things we wanted to teach children
44:44
very early no matter what structure you're in
44:49
never lose track that you are free to choose what you do
44:53
don't allow institutions to determine what you do
44:58
i said: hey man, that you remember that's a big get
45:01
I really love that you could remember that under those conditions
45:03
then what'd you do? I put on my giraffe ears, dad, try to hear
45:08
what he was feeling and needing i said: you remembered to do that?
45:12
what did you hear? pretty obvious, dad.
45:15
looked irritated, wanted me to cut my hair hey wow, man, I'm really glad you remembered
45:22
that how did that leave you feeling?
45:24
dad, I felt sad for the man, he was bald and seemed to have a problem about hair
45:42
so we want children same thing we want to teach adults:
45:46
institutions can't make you do anything other people can't make you do anything
45:53
no human being has ever done anything they didn't choose to do
45:58
a palestinian in the village of Hebron disagreed with me one time
46:01
he said: i don't agree with you, marshall that we only choose to do
46:04
where was my choice two days ago? a soldier puts a gun at my head and says:
46:08
take off your clothes or i'll shoot you where was my choice?
46:11
says: seems pretty obvious to me you had a choice of whether to take off your
46:17
clothes or not he laughed, he said:
46:19
okay, I got your point I chose not to take off my clothes
46:24
I chose that soldier knew i didn't have a gun
46:26
he was doing this to dishonor me i chose to risk my life to protect my honor
46:31
okay, so, i'm not saying we always like the choices we have
46:35
but, nobody can make us do anything we don't choose to do
46:39
so, i said, apparently the soldier also chose not to shoot you
46:43
or else he was a very poor shot my children taught me this about, nobody does
46:50
anything they don't choose to do from the time they were two years old
46:53
they educated me that i couldn't make them do anything
46:58
all i could do is make them wish they had and then they taught me another lesson
47:04
that anytime i would do that they would make me wish i hadn't make them
47:07
wish they had they taught me that violence creates violence
47:13
Part 2: expressing needs and requests okay, the next step then
47:24
we do not attribute responsibility for our feelings
47:27
to the other person i never say, that you make me feel, or i feel,
47:32
because you instead, we are conscious that the root of
47:37
feelings are needs behind every feeling, there is a need
47:45
now certain feelings tell us that there is an obstruction in our thinking
47:50
that instead of our being directly connected to our needs
47:53
we have chosen to go off to jackal land so what are these feelings that tell us that
48:01
we're not directly connected to our needs anger
48:06
depression guilt
48:09
and shame those feelings are very valuable
48:12
they tell us that at this moment i'm not directly connected
48:15
to my needs instead we are up in our head
48:20
telling ourself moralistic judgments about somebody
48:25
anger - we're making moralistic judgments about somebody else
48:28
depression, guilt and shame - we're playing that game on ourself
48:33
but we're not alive in as i would define not being alive, which is
48:37
connected to our needs yeah?
48:44
do you make a distinction between needs and preferences or desires
48:48
yes, we make a big difference as we'll see when we make the next step now
48:52
because needs contain no reference to specific ways of getting the needs met
48:59
those are preferences or strategies, or requests
49:02
we make a big difference between needs, and between
49:07
preferences, requests, strategies so let's get into that
49:13
let's right now connect our feelings with a need
49:19
let's not go up into our head and think about the other person
49:22
let's go into our heart and connect our feeling with our need
49:25
because needs give us the most power with people
49:31
see giraffe is based on a power model power with people
49:36
it increases our power *with* them in the sense that it increases people's willing
49:43
giving to us to enjoy giving to us
49:48
that's power with people we have been trained in a power-over model
49:53
the use of punishment and reward that's power over people
49:57
to get them to do things not because it's coming from their heart
50:01
and they want to contribute to our wellbeing or to life
50:04
not, they want to avoid punishment, or get a reward
50:08
so we wanna increase power *with* people and the most powerful form of communication
50:15
to do that is to bring people's attention to our needs
50:19
that are not getting met when people's full attention is on our needs
50:25
they hear no criticism, no demands it is natural to enjoy giving
50:34
but if we hear any criticism or demand we lose connection with that natural desire
50:40
to give and now we want to defend an attack
50:43
so, let's learn a language of needs under c) it says, imagine again that you are
50:51
talking to the person and express your reasons for feeling as you
50:56
do this way: when you do what i describe, i feel as i'd
51:02
expressed, because i am needing, or because i need
51:06
so now, see if you can identify what need of yours is not getting met
51:14
leave the word "you" out of here that will mix up need and preference
51:18
leave the other person out of here just express the need without reference to
51:24
the other person all needs are universal
51:34
every human being in the world has the same needs
51:37
so, you can look at what you said and see whether this applies
51:42
what you wrote down is a true need every other human being in the world has that
51:47
need we're all created out of the same energy
51:50
so we really see this at the level of needs all human beings have the same needs
51:55
what differs immensely is the strategies that we have been educated in
52:01
for meeting the needs different cultures educate people to meed
52:05
their needs in a different way but the needs are the same
52:12
who wants to check their out, okay? to know that you are responsible, and honest
52:18
that... notice but the other person in there i have a need to know that you are responsible
52:28
and honest how do we express the need without bringing
52:31
the other person in there? see
52:36
now we can't bring it in one way: i have a need for your happiness
52:41
or your protection, we can say that but not the way you're saying it
52:48
yes? i need to be seen and heard as who i truly
52:53
am now, i have an impulse to qualify that and
53:02
say "free" to be...? - free.
53:05
i have a need to be the last word in that sentence is who I truly
53:11
am - free i have the need, who i truly am - to be free
53:15
yes, that's a need we all have the important thing will come out when we
53:20
get to the request cause that's a request only you can meet
53:24
other people can't do that they can't meet that need
53:28
so if you don't know how to meet it for yourself for freedom
53:31
you won't have that need met i'm feeling a bit frustrated, because i am
53:38
noticing that every thing is a strategy in other words, mine is a need for an aesthetic
53:47
environment but underneath that, there is a need for serenity
53:51
and my serenity doesn't come from the environment so, this entire request, starting at a) is
54:00
a strategy to get something called serenity
54:04
okay that's the need than i have a need for certain peace, but
54:07
isn't there a need in there for certain aesthetics, that will...
54:10
right, but it crumbles that house of cards for me
54:15
of wanting the sink filled with dirty dishes help me understand that
54:19
why wouldn't the - if you have a need for serenity
54:22
but serenity doesn't come from clean sink okay, then we haven't got the right need,
54:29
then or - it's not that you want the strategy,
54:33
the sink cleaned up but i'm projecting that need onto the sink,
54:38
thus onto a behavior of someone else
54:40
well, the other person's behavior can be getting in the way of our need getting met
54:45
if the dishes aren't done, it could be some needs of yours are not being met by that
54:49
then you have to identify what the needs are that are not getting met
54:55
i'm not sure - i'm really not sure that i'm basing my...
55:02
an assumption that by having that sink clean that i'm gonna have serenity
55:06
and i think it's a false distinction well the nice thing about being clear about
55:10
our requests is we can test it out
55:14
if i say: for my need for serenity, i'd really be grateful if you would clean
55:19
up the sink the person does it and i'm still not serene
55:21
okay, that helps, I know that doesn't work we never really know what we want until we
55:27
get it if after we get it it makes life more miserable
55:32
than we know that isn't what we wanted if it makes life more wonderful,
55:36
than we know that is - you know, a strategy - that will meet our need
55:40
that's what makes life fun we never know what we want until after we
55:43
get it that's why paul tillich, the theologian, says
55:47
that christianity requires the willingness to sin courageously
55:54
you ask for what you want, hoping to meet your needs,
55:56
you get it, it makes life worse okay - now i want that isn't what i want
56:01
wouldn't it be boring to know what is real yes?
56:06
when, okay, when you do what i described
56:12
i feel as i expressed, because i need respect and aknowledgement,
56:16
and i need to be able to feel safe in my job environment
56:19
i hear needs in there, yes when you do what i described,
56:28
i feel as i expressed because i need to express my desires and need without it
56:34
hurting you no, no, no, now we got a bunch of stuff in
56:38
there oh, shoot
56:39
if you want to avoid hurting other people the only way i can offer you to do that
56:45
is to become a nice dead person yup
56:51
because if other people have jackal ears, they can get hurt if you have heartburn
56:56
so what, i just cut off that second half? just...
56:59
i need to express my desires and needs? yes, and then what you wanna say to yourself
57:05
and i wanna do to enjoy your pain which is, we're gonna show you after lunch
57:11
how to enjoy the other person's pain oooh, that's sounds...
57:15
it's one of the most loving things you could do, you see
57:19
as i would define it, obviously i don't mean in a sadistic way
57:23
yes? so, i have a couple i'm working on
57:26
one of them is: because i have a need for predictability
57:31
i have a need for predictability, okay and the other one would be: because i have
57:35
a need for privacy yeah
57:42
my need is for comradeship, and acknowledgment of my comradeship
57:54
i have a need to memorialize the life of your father, and in doing so
57:58
honor the life of your entire family you have a need to honor this life, yes
58:05
i have a need to have communication with other people that is open
58:13
and supportive of life your need for supporting of life, openness,
58:20
okay? when you do this, i feel hurt because i have
58:25
a need to be heard and understood yes, very important need
58:32
that need for understanding, to be heard to be listened to, empathy
58:37
there's different ways of expressing it but it's a critical need
58:40
one that we have daily daily, yes
58:44
bottom line: i have a need to love you and to let your loving
58:51
i have a need to love, but don't bring the other person in there
58:55
i have a need for love i have a need to let loving
58:58
and to let love, yes see, our needs don't
59:05
when we believe that our needs involve another person doing something
59:10
we take a very abundant world, and make it scarce very quickly
59:15
so we don't wanna mix up our needs and request we may have a request, a strong request
59:21
that a particular person meet our need for love
59:26
that's a strategy we may want this particular person
59:28
but we don't have a need for that person to love us
59:31
that's mixing up the need and the request we have a need for love
59:34
we have a strong preference this person takes the action to meet that need
59:41
we don't wanna mix up the need and the strategy ok, let's take one more and then we'll gotta
59:47
move on yes? yeah, I'm confused it this is a need
59:50
or a strategy okay
59:51
i need to feel loved aah, love is a very important word
59:56
i need love, yes but now, that word "love" is so important
60:02
that it's, we gotta get real clear about what we mean
60:04
about it when we use it as a giraffe
60:06
that's what happens when a giraffe and a jackal get together on this love
60:10
see, this is it watch this jackal ask a very dangerous question,
60:16
but notice that the giraffe is too smart ever to answer this question
60:20
watch do you love me?
60:24
jackal, before i can answer your question honestly
60:29
i need to get some important things clear are you using the word "love" as a feeling?
60:34
well, of course okay, well i needed to get that clear
60:38
so you mean, am i feeling certain warm, cuddly, tender feelings toward you
60:44
yes okay, i needed to get this clear
60:47
cause see we giraffes do not use the word "love" as a feeling
60:51
it's much too important to get it confused with a feeling
60:55
it's a need for us but since you use it as a feeling
61:00
okay, i'm glad to know that so would you please than,
61:03
now that i know that, would you ask the question again?
61:07
do you love me? when?
61:13
when?? well, i want to be honest
61:20
i can see how important this is to you but how can i be honest with you
61:24
about what i feel toward you without reference to a specific moment?
61:30
feelings change every few seconds life is changing
61:33
feelings are part of life, so i'd have to know a specific time and place
61:38
to ever answer your question of how i feel what about right now?
61:47
no but try again in a few moments
61:59
so you see, to a giraffe love is a need and it's a need for which we must be very
62:04
clear about what requests do we have of other people
62:09
to meet that need now, once again what happens, with reference
62:15
to that if we are in a love relationship with a jackal
62:20
i want you to love me oh, so you have a need for love, jackal,
62:24
and you're giving me the honor of wanting do you to meet that need
62:27
yes i really see how important the need of love
62:30
is so i want to be clear what you would like
62:33
for me to meet your need could you tell me what you are requesting
62:37
of me to meet your need now the poor jackals
62:40
they don't live in the moment you see and to make a clear request
62:44
you have to live now you have to be clear what you want
62:47
so watch how the jackal handles this so could you tell me, what you want me to
62:53
do? to meet your need for love?
62:57
oh, you know nah, i'm not sure i do
63:03
i really see how important this need is for you
63:07
so can you tell me, specifically, what you would like me to meet your need for love
63:12
well, it's hard to say in so many words if it's hard for you to say, jackal, can you
63:19
see how hard it will be fore me to do? I never thought of that
63:26
so what would you like me to do? to meet your need for love?
63:36
it's embarrassing to get clear yes, it is, cause much of our oppression in
63:40
close relationships comes from saying to people:
63:43
i want you to respect me, i want you to love me
63:46
i want you to understand me without being real clear what we want when
63:50
we say that so what are you wanting, jackal, when you
63:53
say you want me to love you?
63:55
i want you to guess what i want before i even know what it is
64:01
and i want you always to be willing to do it
64:04
thank you for defining it that way, jackal would you please find someone else to meet
64:10
your need for love? most jackals that carry that definition of
64:20
love around with them find out how impossible it is to meet on about
64:23
their fifth divorce you see, they keep thinking that they're gonna
64:29
find the right person to love them not realizing the problem is
64:33
how they're defining love and what they want from other people to meet
64:37
their need for love to see that it's impossible to meet that need
64:41
which brings us to the next step in the process how to make clear requests
64:47
after we have expressed our unmet needs and a clear request defined in giraffe is
64:53
first, it's a positive action we say what we do want
64:58
not what we don't want so a woman gave me a very good example of
65:04
what happens when you say what you don't want
65:07
in a workshop, she said: you really helped me understand what happened
65:11
recently, Marshall I said to my husband:
65:14
I don't want you spending so much time at work
65:16
and then I got furious with him when he sign up for a gold tournament
65:25
the teacher gave me a similar example: she said, just yesterday, marshall, i said
65:33
to this young boy: please I don't want you tapping on your book
65:37
while i'm talking so he started to tap on his desk
65:43
saying what we don't want doesn't make clear what we do want
65:47
but worse than that if we frame our objectives in getting rid
65:51
of something it leads to violence very often
65:54
it makes violence seem attractive when we try to get rid of something
66:00
for example, i was working with some teachers in a school
66:02
in rockford, illinois their observable behavior they wanted to work
66:07
on was on the average every three months
66:09
thirty eight broken windows in school so we got down to requests
66:14
i said: what do you want, different, from the students?
66:17
it's obvious, we don't want them breaking windows
66:21
so you're saying you don't want the children breaking windows
66:23
yes, what should we do? kill them
66:31
research has demonstrated dead children break no windows
66:41
almost anytime we think of what we wanna get rid of
66:44
it makes violence look attractive and as stupid as that example was i just gave
66:47
you look at newspaper any given day
66:49
and see how many world leaders are saying: we're gonna teach them not to
66:53
we're gonna get them to stop and think violence is going to...
66:57
see it always make violence seem attractive to you
67:02
it's only as i said earlier when we get two questions clear:
67:05
what *do* we want people to do and what do we want their reasons to be for
67:10
doing it? then i think we'll see violence never works
67:14
okay, so we wanna say what we wanna say in the positive
67:17
what *do* we want the other person to do what do we want them to start doing differently
67:22
and second, that it needs to be clear action language
67:26
we can't do what this one wife did with her husband
67:29
who came to the workshop with her she said: i want you to listen to me when
67:33
i talk he said: i do listen
67:35
no, you don't yes, i do
67:38
no, you don't they told me they'd had this same conversation
67:42
for eleven years the problem is with the word listen
67:48
what does that...? we can use the word listen as a need
67:50
i have a need to be listened to but when we move to
67:53
request, we need to speak action language what specific action do we want this person
68:01
to take? we can't use the word "to be"
68:04
i want you to be more friendly not doable
68:08
we can't use feeling language i want you to feel confidence in yourself
68:12
that's not doable so we need to be able to make very concrete
68:17
request try it out with what is under d) there
68:23
in relation to what the other person did and your feelings and needs
68:27
in relation to the action imagine you're talking directly to the person
68:31
and express a request using this form: I would like you to...
68:36
what do you want the person to do to meet your needs
68:43
i want you to obey my instruction let's use the word "i want you to do what
68:53
i told you to do" i want you to do what i told you to
68:58
and if you were a giraffe you would give that to the person with a little
69:03
card that said: but please, do as i requested
69:11
only if you can do so with the joy of a little
69:16
child feeding a hungry duck please, do not do as i request,
69:22
if there is any fear of punishment motivating you
69:25
please do not do as i request out of... hope for reward, that i would like
69:31
you if you do please do not do as i request
69:34
out of guilt, shame, duty, obligation life is too short to do anything for anybody
69:41
out of that so, what i'm getting at is:
69:44
when we do make a request we want it to be sure that the person trusts
69:47
that it's a request not a demand
69:52
so we'll come back to that le'ts just work on the clarity of the request
69:55
to begin with yes, so what is your request?
69:57
i would like you to do what was agreed upon okay
70:04
give me the space to complete my thoughts too vague, give me the space
70:09
let me...? let me is not doable
70:16
let me show you what i mean a woman said to her husband came to the workshop
70:22
i want you to give me the freedom to be myself he says: i do
70:26
no, you don't i said: hold it, hold it
70:29
give me the freedom is not doable let me?
70:32
no, that's not doable allow me?
70:35
that's not doable what do you want from him when you say "give
70:39
you the freedom to be yourself"? it's embarrassing
70:42
yeah? well say it
70:46
say it out loud what do you want when you say all of that
70:51
i want him to smile and say it's okay no matter what i do
70:54
okay, now you're honest you see, so what do you want?
70:59
i wanna express myself yes, you can do that
71:03
nobody can stop you from expressing yourself no, i'm getting interrupted
71:07
you want the other person to wait until you finish speaking?
71:10
yes before starting?
71:11
yes okay, that's a doable action
71:15
so how do we know? you can only tell whether it's a request or
71:20
a demand by how i treat you if you don't do it
71:25
that's what tells people whether we are making requests
71:27
or demands what is their memory of how we act when we
71:31
don't get what we want? if people have in their memory any punishment
71:37
on our part in the past when they don't do what we want
71:39
any blame it will now be hard for them to trust that
71:44
we are making a request and not a demand
71:46
it will take the joy out of giving to us so let's follow that example a little bit
71:54
more for me to show you what i mean so i say to you I'm really lonely this evening
71:59
and... have a need for some company would you be willing to spend the evening
72:04
with me? and you say, marshall, i am really preoccupied
72:08
with some things at work and i really need some space to myself this evening
72:12
could you find someone else to be with you this evening?
72:16
and here's my reaction: two days later:
72:27
you: what's the matter? nothing
72:37
you: come on, what's the matter? you knew how lonely i was
72:47
if you loved me... now was it a request or a demand?
72:54
we can't tell from how nicely it was asked we need to see how the person treats us
73:00
when we don't do what they want that's when we trust that they make requests
73:05
and not demands we are going to pay
73:07
for every time in the past when we used any coercive means
73:11
to get what we wanted so now at least we don't want them to paying
73:16
for it that anymore
73:16
we want to be sure that whenever we make a request
73:20
it is a request now that doesn't mean the other person will
73:23
trust it even if it is because unfortunately
73:26
there's been so much coercion in our world that even if we are making sincere requests
73:31
the other person might hear a demand i was working in one school system with a
73:37
group of students that the school district labeled as
73:42
"socially and emotionally maladjusted" now, from what you've learned today,
73:48
was that a jackal school system, or a giraffe school system?
73:52
yes it sounds like in your example the person
73:57
was really disappointed really let down
74:00
not let down, that's a diagnosis okay
74:03
they're really disappointed really hurt
74:05
okay so, how could they have expressed that
74:11
without it being a demand but not suppressing the fact that they're
74:14
really disappointed they could say:
74:19
so you have a lot to do right now and it would really meet your need to be by
74:24
yourself yeah
74:28
and the kind of mood i'm in right now
74:33
i really trust that you would meet it better than anybody else i know
74:37
is there some way that we could find to get your work done
74:40
and still meet my need for connection tonight? that's what we call dogging for our needs
74:49
and that shows respect for the other person's needs
74:53
I'm not trying to use any guilt, manipulation I'm just trying now to find the way to get
74:58
everybody's needs met okay?
75:08
if the person can not think of somebody to replace them
75:12
it will not be a problem it will only be a problem if i put on these
75:16
ears and receive in what they said a rejection
75:20
if i hear a rejection that's the problem
75:26
you can say i'm disappointed as long as you say you disappoint me
75:30
as long as you don't stop after i'm disappointed that's just another way of saying you disappoint
75:38
me we always have to end the feeling
75:41
at the very end of it there's gonna be a request we don't just say i'm disappointed
75:46
we'd have to say we have to take responsibility for asking
75:50
for what we want given the other person has this other need
75:53
okay, what do you want then, from me? jackal doesn't like that game
75:59
doesn't like to be responsible for what they want
76:02
they'd rather say: well, if they loved me if they were any kind of friend
76:09
i think it's only fair that they they wanna control by guilt, shame
76:18
so, the school district asked me to work with these students
76:24
that were labeled socially and emotionally maladjusted
76:27
poor school system doesn't realize that labels lead to self-fulfilling prophecies
76:33
when you label people that way, they're gonna behave that way
76:37
come on, be honest: if you were labeled socially and emotionally
76:40
maladjusted you're one of those students
76:43
doesn't that give you permission to have fun in school?
76:47
labels lead to self-fulfilling prophecies so i knew it was going to be a rough day
76:52
just by that label so when i walked in to the classroom
76:56
it already starts half of the students are hanging out the window
76:59
screaming obscenities at their friends in the courtyard down below
77:04
so i made a request: excuse me, i would like you all to come on
77:07
over and sit down please i'd like to tell you who i am, what i'd like
77:11
to do today half the student come over
77:15
i wasn't sure the other half had even heard me
77:18
so i repeated it: would you all please come over
77:22
now everybody comes over with the exception of two young men
77:27
just my luck, the two that didn't come over were the biggest ones in the classroom
77:31
then again i wasn't too sure they'd heard me
77:34
and i was praying it might just be a problem with acoustics
77:36
so i said: would one of you two gentlemen tell me
77:40
please what you heard me say yeah, you said we have to come over and sit
77:44
down you see the problem?
77:47
i make a request he hears a demand
77:53
so i said, sir i have learned always use sir with people
77:57
who have biceps like he did especially with the tattoo on top of the bicep
78:04
i said: sir, could you tell me how i could have let you know
78:07
what i was requesting so it wouldn't sound like i was
78:09
telling you what you had to do? he said: huh?
78:15
see, that's a radical paradigm shift for somebody who's been
78:19
educated under domination conditions domination structures where authorities
78:25
claim to know what's right you have to do it or else
78:28
you see it's a radical paradigm shift
78:31
in giraffe school people don't make demands they just make requests
78:37
so i realized this is not gonna be easy with this gentleman
78:40
his probably carrying with him a lot of traces of being punished
78:44
when he doesn't do what other people want or blame
78:48
I'm not expecting him to give it up like that so i said, sir, how could i let you know
78:53
that i was requesting something of you without it sounding like i was bossing you
78:57
around? i don't know
79:00
i said: just what's happening between you and me right now
79:04
is much that i wanted to talk about today i was wanting to look we can interact
79:10
when nobody bosses other around and i didn't expect life to be so easy
79:16
it was all he needed he trusted at that point I wasn't trying to
79:19
tell him what to do and he came over and we had a very cooperative
79:23
day but as long as people hear or request as demands,
79:27
they have only two choices: submission or rebellion
79:32
and neither of us are gonna connect us with people
79:34
that's good for anybody so the main thing that's the difference
79:40
is not how nicely we say it, but how we treat people,
79:44
when they don't do what we want now, let's hear a few of these
79:48
so we can see what kind of reactions you might get back
79:54
if you openly express your heart you try to do your best not to criticize,
79:58
not to demand what do you get back?
80:02
she gets excited and defends herself I need to hear the specific statement
80:07
cause I don't know what you mean by defends herself
80:10
what does she say? gotta be specific
80:16
for the next exercise, we need to know specifically what the person says or does
80:20
see that's your diagnosis, that she's defensive what does she say?
80:33
sometimes things happen and I'm not ready to leave
80:37
when we agreed well sometimes things happen and I'm not ready
80:40
to leave when I agreed okay, that's what the person says
80:45
i can't do that, because i have a hard time connecting with people as partners
80:49
i can't do that, because i have a hard time connecting with people as partners can't do
80:53
that, because i have a hard time connecting with people as partners
80:58
this is their response, back yes, what the person responds back
81:02
he says: nothing i do is ever good enough nothing i do is ever good enough
81:06
okay, here: guess i should go through the whole thing
81:15
she says she doesn't like the way i wash dishes or make the bed
81:20
yes i feel angry and resentful
81:22
yes i feel as i expressed because i need to be
81:27
accepted for my willingness and ability to do a job
81:31
they way i do it yes
81:34
i would like you to acknowledge my work positively even if i don't feel like it?
81:43
how do you want me to respond positively when an idiot could do a better job making
81:50
a bed than you do
81:52
okay, that's a last thing she would say but she can't because i never do it the way
81:57
it should be done yeah, so the problem there is the present
82:01
request what do you want from this person?
82:04
i think what you'd like is this: i'd like at least some gratitude expressed
82:09
for my willingness to do what i do and if i could get at least the gratitude
82:14
for that first I could better hear how would you like me to do it differently
82:18
would that be closer? it'd be closer but i'd still like her to accept
82:23
the way that i do it what does accept mean?
82:25
now we have to translate "accept" into a doable request
82:28
what if this person has a sense of aesthetics you see i can already tell what the problem
82:34
is in your relationship
82:35
i already made a diagnosis you wanna hear my diagnosis?
82:38
okay you are a slob, and she's a neat
82:41
see there's these two kinds of people in the world
82:46
slobs and neats and for some reason rather than other
82:49
they always live together i... it doesn't make sense to me
82:56
you see, there's so much of this goes on every day
82:58
about how to... keep to, wash the dishes how to make the bed
83:03
i'll give away which one i am i once made... i once cleaned the house immaculately
83:08
and my partner came home and said I thought you were gonna clean
83:11
true story so you know what i am, right?
83:18
uh, i wrote her a song that night, that goes: if you wonder about the cause of my domestic
83:24
distress it's that my partner is antiseptic and i'm
83:27
a total mess last night at 2 am i had to go to the HEB
83:34
in the time it took me she made the bed so there are these slobs and neats
83:45
and they always get together i have a plan for world peace:
83:48
put the slobs in one hemisphere the neats in another
83:52
so how does that get back to needs and men now that you'd diagnosed that how would you
84:01
handle it now the answer would probably be this:
84:04
you have to say to the neat i'd like you to agree that
84:10
there can be different ways of doing things is that what you want?
84:17
my solution was that i just don't do it a typical slob solution
84:24
i could've guesses that it worked
84:35
i would really liked some acknowledgement first, i'd like some expression of gratitude
84:39
for what i did i'm not saying you have to like it
84:43
but i'd like to hear some gratitude, if it's sincere,
84:46
that at least that i was trying second i'd like you to agree that there can
84:50
be different ways of defining what is an adequate
84:52
way to make a bed then, if after you agree to that,
84:57
if you could say what your preference would be
85:00
without using words that imply that it's right, your way,
85:04
that would be a lot easier something like that
85:10
you sound like you're doing something out of a book
85:13
you sound like you're doing something out of a book
85:16
talk like a real person don't use any of this psychology crap on me
85:20
something like that, yes yes yes
85:23
especially they're gonna say that if you're a baby giraffe
85:25
you know cause you're trying a new that and it's gonna take a while
85:29
and it's gonna go slowly and when i was first learning this
85:33
i was having a conflict with my oldest son and
85:36
i was sounding like it was coming out of a book
85:38
i was having to stop and think everything i said
85:41
and the poor guy he had his friends waiting for him
85:44
and he said: daddy, it's taking you so long to talk
85:48
i said: let me tell you what i can say quickly: do it my way or i kick your ass
85:51
he said: take your time, dad those who know me and my old jackal days
86:11
are very patient with my sounding like i'm coming out of a book
86:14
yes? there's no value in changing who i am i'm
86:23
satisfied the way it is yes, there's no value in changing who i am
86:28
i'm satisfied the way i am that... we can already tell then this person
86:31
heard a demand you see they're hearing a demand as though you're
86:34
saying they're not okay the way they are
86:36
and that would be how i would bet a person would respond if they hear a demand
86:41
different ways of people respond when they hear a demand
86:44
my preference is for how my youngest son once responded when
86:48
he heard a demand i said: would you please hang up your coat?
86:51
he said: who was your slave before i was born? i like that way because
87:06
i knows he hears a demand then right? it's pretty clear
87:08
and uh- then there's other people who it's harder to guess they're hearing is a
87:14
demand for example you said to them:
87:16
would you please come over and just sit on the couch with me and talk with me?
87:19
the person goes like this: okay
87:25
now if you're smart you'll say oh no, stay away
87:29
they're hearing a demand you see but they're giving in
87:34
but the worst case scenario this is a dangerous one, you see
87:38
is if the person hears your request as a demand and they respond this way
87:43
oh sure, sure i'll do it and they do it
87:48
but they did it to buy your love they did it because they were afraid that
87:51
if they didn't you wouldn't like them
87:53
now how will you find out? you'll find out eventually
87:59
you might find out like this one woman did who showed up at my door in two in the morning
88:05
two in the morning my doorbell's ringing one morning
88:08
it's pouring rain outside and this woman, not eight months pregnant
88:14
crying i said: come in, come in
88:17
i sat her down in a chair what's going on?
88:20
i didn't know how she got there she told me that her mother had been in a
88:25
workshop with me a month before
88:27
and she had just called her mother up to tell her about what happened
88:31
and the mother said oh there's a man in your town
88:34
that that you might wanna go and talk to so, that's how this woman shows up at my door
88:38
at two o'clock in the morning now what was the problem?
88:41
earlier, she said i just made a little request to my husband
88:46
and he said: get out we've been married eight years
88:46
he's always been so loving so kind he's done everything i want
88:47
and now he says get out already i knew what the problem was
89:01
he was a yes-saying jackal he hears somebody he loves wants something
89:07
and he feels he has to do it to make, to buy love
89:11
to prove that he's a loving person and so how does she find this out?
89:15
it took eight years but then she pays for it one night
89:18
and i know i was right how do i know i was right
89:22
i got him out of bed why should i be up at two in the morning
89:28
talking to his wife while he's sleeping so i called him up and invited him over
89:35
and sure enough you see he was a yes-saying jackal
89:38
he just didn't know how to say no so he had been giving in for all these years
89:42
and then finally this night he snapped that's how you find out, after eight years
89:47
she found out that he was hearing demands
89:50
and lovingly giving in to them you certainly don't want to ever receive those
89:56
messages any one that you just responded to
90:00
you never wanna hear what the other person thinks
90:05
never hear what a jackal speaking person thinks you'll live longer
90:12
so, certainly after lunch we're gonna say: do not hear what the person thought
90:17
whatever thoughts they expressed never hear what a jackal speaking person thinks
90:23
especially when they think about you so we'll show you other options than that
90:32
we'll show you how never to hear a criticism we'll show you all of that after lunch
90:40
part three: empathically hearing others there's only two things that human beings
90:51
are ever saying please and thank you
90:56
that's all human beings are ever saying the only thing is jackal speaking people have
91:04
learned to say please in a suicidal way
91:12
think about that for a moment what else is human beings ever saying except
91:15
please you're behaving in a way that isn't meeting
91:19
my needs or my needs are not getting met by something
91:22
else would you please do this to meet my needs
91:25
that's, we need to know how to say that well to survive in the world
91:31
when our needs are not getting met we need to know how to say please
91:34
in a way that makes it enjoyable for people to give it to us
91:38
alright this morning we learned how to do that
91:42
just learned how to say what you are feeling and needing
91:45
and make a clear request make sure that no words come out of your mouth
91:51
that imply wrongness on the part of other people
91:55
do everything you can to promote in people the trust
91:58
that when you make a request it is a request and not a demand
92:03
and that increases the likelihood that people will enjoy giving to you
92:06
so we studied that this morning now the other half of the process is how to
92:13
receive from other people what's alive in them
92:19
and what they are needing to make life wonderful and how to receive that without hearing any
92:25
criticism or demand just to hear what's alive in them
92:31
and we need to learn how to do this even when these other people are saying please
92:36
in this strange way that we've been educated to say please
92:40
you know you are all speaking perfect giraffe for about a year
92:45
so what i'm really teaching you now is not a second language
92:48
it's really your first language i'm bringing you back to life
92:52
to nature, your first language so now the other half
92:57
how do we respond to a jackal's pleas when the jackal is expressing the pleas this
93:03
way the problem with you is that you are too
93:10
that's please that person's in pain
93:15
that person has a need that isn't getting met
93:19
and isn't it sad that they only know that way to ask for it?
93:24
isn't that tragic for this person to be saying please in a way that almost guarantees
93:30
you're not gonna get what you want or if you do it's gonna be motivated by fear,
93:35
guilt or shame and you're gonna pay for it
93:38
how sad to be educated that way and now of course it would be even sadder
93:45
if when the person says please that way you don't hear the please
93:49
you hear a criticism that's when we have war
93:56
somebody in pain does their best to express it
93:58
person on the other hand hears a criticism so let me tell you what the person
94:05
that you were working on this morning all of the messages that i heard you relate
94:09
that what you predict they might say back here's what i hear the person saying
94:14
i heard the person you're speaking with saying this back to you:
94:19
i'm in pain i have a need that isn't getting met
94:23
okay? that's what the person was saying
94:28
in the message that you wrote down i'm in pain, because a need of mine
94:34
isn't getting met now hear that
94:40
put on giraffe ears and say this back to the person:
94:47
- are you feeling...? - and guess what that person is feeling
94:52
when they say what they did - because you are needing -
94:57
and guess what they're need is so i'm asking you to go back to the message
95:04
that you predicted you might get back i'm wanting you to imagine the person
95:10
actually says this to you and now if you have giraffe ears on here will
95:14
be you reaction: are you feeling - guess their feeling
95:21
because you are needing - guess their need with giraffe ears all you can hear
95:31
are feelings and needs you can hear no criticism
95:37
a number of years ago i was working with a group of women in religious life
95:49
and they had a conflict for some fifteen months that was creating great pain in their community
95:57
and they asked me to help them resolve this and i suggested that we begin
96:07
by having everybody express their needs what needs of yours are not getting met?
96:12
in this situation and after the first speaker's second word
96:19
i could see why after fifteen months not only had they not
96:23
been able to resolve the issue
96:25
but why it was causing increasing pain can anybody guess what the second word was?
96:38
but what was the second word? first word was "I"
96:46
I think yes, that's... as soon as i heard
96:50
that second word i could see why
96:53
notice my question of them was: what needs of yours
96:56
are not getting met and instead of an answer, I got "I think"
97:01
immediately I knew - trouble and here's what the rest of the message said:
97:07
I think that if we are to be in religious life
97:11
we must take our commitments seriously and dress as though... and dress in an appropriate
97:18
way see i asked for a need
97:26
that's what i got back and then another religious sister said
97:32
sister i agree but i think
97:41
fifteen months what was the issue?
97:44
the issue was whether to wear traditional clothing or not
97:47
you see this was the issue fifteen months had not been able to resolve
97:51
it in fact a great pain in that fifteen months
97:55
the community was divided but i asked what are you needing
98:00
and i got thoughts thoughts you see
98:07
so it took me a while to teach them never to hear the thoughts
98:12
to not hear thoughts only use the thoughts as a window
98:20
look through the thoughts to the needs that are behind
98:25
hear the needs behind it would be a whole different world
98:29
don't hear thoughts they finally got it
98:34
they finally started to look through the words and the thoughts
98:38
to what was behind and then amazing how in a short time
98:43
we resolved the conflict my partner ruth bebermayer was with me at
98:48
the time and saw this miracle that comes whenever we
98:51
hear through the words to what's behind them
99:00
i feel so saddened by your words i feel so judged and sent away
99:11
before i go i'd like to know is that what you meant to say?
99:22
before i rise to my defense before i speak in hurts or fear
99:33
before i build that wall of words tell me did i really hear
99:45
words are windows or they're walls they sentence us or set us free
99:52
when i speak and when i hear let the love light shine through me
100:08
there are things i need to say things that mean so much to me
100:18
if my words don't make me clear will you help me to be free
100:31
if i seem to put you down if you felt i didn't care
100:42
try to listen through my words to the feelings that we share
100:52
words are windows or they're walls they sentence us or set us free
101:02
when i speak and when i hear let the love light shine through me
101:22
so with your giraffe ears on you hear the feelings behind the words
101:27
you hear the needs every moment we have feelings and needs
101:34
so we're hearing the truth what's really alive in this person
101:37
it's better for you to only hear that cause then you don't live in a world of criticism
101:42
or judgment you take away all power from other people
101:46
to dehumanize you when you have giraffe ears on
101:50
you never have to worry about other people's reaction
101:54
to what you're saying you can be honest without fear
101:58
cause you know I don't ever have to worry about
102:00
how other respond only what ears i have on to respond to their
102:05
response but i can control that
102:09
i can't control how others respond and if i'm gonna worry about something i can't
102:14
control i'll become a nice dead person
102:17
i'll be afraid to reveal myself or fear: what if they say this?
102:22
who cares what they say? if you have giraffe ears on it's a gift
102:26
all they're saying is: please please
102:30
so let's hear the please behind the message that you hear
102:33
first read off the message and then let's hear
102:36
how you heard the feelings and needs behind it
102:41
what i expect my daughter would say was: i can't control myself when i'm so angry
102:50
i can't control myself when i'm so angry and when i thought about it
102:55
um, i would think i could say are you feeling frustrated because you are
102:59
needing some other ways to express your anger?
103:03
that's what i asked you to do to try to hear the feelings and needs
103:07
and even if that's not accurate notice what it does
103:11
even if it's wrong it demonstrates a value
103:16
it demonstrates that you value what's alive in that person
103:20
that you're taking the time to try to connect with what's alive in that
103:26
person when people trust that that's what interesting
103:30
to you already we can solve anything
103:35
what makes it hard to resolve things is when people
103:37
feel the other person is only interested in winning
103:39
they don't care about me they're just out to show me that i shouldn't
103:44
do this but by just stopping and trying to connect
103:48
we've demonstrated a powerful value that you value what's alive in them
103:54
okay? another one. yes?
103:57
uh, with my, related to my son are you feeling distressed, confused because
104:04
you are needing help? that's the idea
104:07
and again, even if it's not accurate it gives the... notice even if it's not accurate
104:12
it brings the other person's attention to their needs
104:15
it gives them a chance to correct it better to be guessing wrong
104:23
what a person's need is than to hearing what they think
104:27
you'll be living in a different world when you are trying to connect with their
104:31
needs than the world you'll be living in
104:33
if you hear what they think i need some help in
104:37
addressing the feelings and needs behind the answer that i got back
104:47
which was one of the things that you said before lunch which can be the most dangerous
104:52
when somebody just said you make a request and somebody says yes i'll do that
104:55
yeah can you help me... i mean i could guess
104:59
i mean what i wrote down was are you feeling
105:02
um pain because you're needing recognition for the job you're doing
105:09
okay i like that but i mean it feels like there's a huge leap
105:16
from the response yes i'll do that to me asking that question
105:22
yeah, it's you're trying to sense what's really behind it
105:26
that's one of the two giraffe ways the other possibility that would also be giraffe
105:30
is to say bullshit in giraffe how do you say bullshit in giraffe?
105:37
i'm feeling uneasy with your okay okay
105:41
i wish i could trust it but i don't i'd really like you to take a moment
105:46
and really tell me whether it would meet your needs
105:48
to do as i request so that's when i would guess that the okay
105:53
isn't okay so that's how i would say bullshit in giraffe
105:59
thank you giraffes are not nice
106:04
much of i think the violence in the world is created
106:06
by nice people so, don't mistake the word non-violence as
106:10
being nice are you feeling abandoned
106:17
not a feeling it's a thought
106:19
don't encourage jackals to think that way are you feeling afraid
106:25
now we're cooking because you're needing reassurance
106:30
now we're cooking that i will not disappear
106:34
that your needs will be taken care of leave yourself out of the other person's needs
106:39
they can live without you all of their needs can be met without you
106:52
how could i satisfy your needs? that's a jackal question
106:56
that kind of question if the other person is smart
106:58
they'll take the fifth amendment yeah
107:05
this was an answer to when my daughter said you sound like you're reading from a book
107:12
you sound like you're reading from a book and i say: are you feeling scared, separate
107:18
and alienated and are you needed to be responded to in a
107:22
genuine, heartfelt way?
107:24
yes but you're doing it again
107:26
when you do that so with such a jackal for a while
107:35
until you make clear why you're doing it so they will have less distrust of it
107:40
you would do just as you said but silently
107:44
silently? yes
107:45
don't think we have to do this all out loud for it to be powerful
107:48
it can be powerful if we don't say a word as long as where our attention is
107:55
is here even if... so you might have heard just that
108:01
but maybe not have said it out loud that's all you can hear with the giraffe ears
108:08
on and you can hear that even when you're silent
108:11
you don't have to say it out loud you could just have heard that
108:14
but you'll show that your attention is here from your eyes
108:18
because when we're hearing what is in a person's heart
108:21
our eyes are different than when we're hearing a criticism
108:26
or when we're making a criticism our eyes... it's not subtle
108:37
now the advantage of being able to say it out loud
108:40
is that person can correct us if we're not accurate
108:44
but even if we don't say it out loud we live in a different world
108:49
when we're connecting here than when we're hearing criticism
108:56
this is a the question would be
109:04
that i would have asked would... be something like
109:07
i would like you to ask me for help if you need it
109:12
yes and then the person responds
109:15
i'm afraid of becoming a burden now, that's almost a giraffe response
109:21
how do you respond to this person? i'm afraid of becoming a burden
109:24
now if you are jackal you say no, you wouldn't be a burden
109:27
so if you're a jackal you'll try to reassure her
109:34
jackals try to fix people in pain they try to give reassurance
109:41
they try to make it better they can't stand pain
109:44
they immediately make matters worse by trying to get rid of the pain
109:50
in the book "when bad things happen to good people"
109:55
by rabbi Harold Kushner he's talking about a very tragic time in his
109:59
life when his oldest son is dying
110:02
and he said: what could be worse than watching my son die?
110:07
what could be worse were the things that good people were telling me to make me
110:10
feel better that made me feel worse
110:13
and what could be even more horrible than that?
110:19
what they were doing what they were saying that made me feel worse
110:22
were exactly the things i had been saying to other people
110:25
for twenty years in my role as a rabbi he had been responding by trying to make it
110:32
better so we don't wanna do that now
110:37
this is an important message well i'm afraid that i'll be a burden
110:41
so put on giraffe ears what is this person feeling and needing when
110:44
they say that are you feeling...
110:58
afraid, they've already told you the feeling that's easy
111:02
afraid... so you're feeling afraid because - why?
111:06
why are they afraid that you don't trust my offer to help
111:12
now put that in a need you need some reassurance
111:18
that i'll really be there? no, I need reassurance that if you're there
111:23
you're doing it for you and not for me
111:28
they wanna be sure that if you're giving you're giving out of self-fullness, not self-lessness
111:33
now what about if you're not a hundred percent? don't do it
111:46
i would suggest you heed joseph campbell's advice
111:49
when he, having studied all the basic myths of the world
111:53
in the basic religions, concludes that if there's one wise thing that seems present
111:58
in all the basic religions it's this: don't do anything that isn't play
112:02
yes, don't do anything that isn't play and it will be play if you're meeting your
112:14
own needs so don't do things for other people
112:20
well the only right way is to hold it, hold it
112:23
your ears just dropped off put your ears back on
112:27
cause if your ears are on you will never hear the word "right"
112:31
it doesn't exist if you hear that word
112:34
it's gonna be toxic never hear another person telling you what's
112:37
right it's not good for them
112:40
it's not good for you okay, so just hear feelings and needs
112:44
i told you thirty times you don't listen
112:52
my god what's... you see this bed? no you don't
113:04
you're proving now you don't if you were listening you wouldn't say i listen
113:09
isn't it funny how he always comes in pardon
113:12
it's funny how you always comes in yeah, so
113:15
what's this person feeling and needing let me help you out
113:26
let me put on some giraffe ears here so, jackal is it that
113:36
it's frustrating when you have a certain sense of order
113:39
and you'd really like to have that order maintained in the house
113:44
well that's a part of it but it's not that... it's not the only thing
113:48
it's i told him over and over again oh, is it that you feel hurt because you have
113:55
a need to feel like your needs matter?
113:57
yes it's like this doesn't matter to him
113:59
he doesn't care ah, so what's really the pain for you in this
114:06
is your need to feel like you matter your needs matter
114:09
yes so, how do you feel when you hear the jackal
114:17
say this i'm feeling like i... well it's not a feeling
114:34
um i'm glad you're catching it
114:38
feeling confused yeah?
114:39
feeling confused primarily because i can't identify the needs
114:46
that are being expressed
114:48
so you would really like to be able to hear a need like that
114:51
when it's really going on? yeah i would like that
114:55
you don't act like you do hold it, jackal
115:01
that isn't going to make it easier for him, jackal
115:06
that isn't gonna make it easier so you're really
115:09
it's really painful for you it's hard to believe that he cares enough
115:13
to really matter yes you know cause i've told him over and
115:15
over so so it's really an issue for you of whether
115:19
your needs matter yes
115:21
i'm feeling that it's not so much the beds or the dishes though
115:29
feeling like it's something else i'm just telling you what it is
115:33
it's the general feel i have that my needs don't matter to you
115:41
how do you feel when the jackal tells you that?
115:45
still confused what makes you confused about this?
115:48
cause i don't know how to respond to those needs
115:53
what it would take is just empathy if she could just feel the empathy that i
115:57
just gave her if you could just say
116:00
are you feeling in pain cause you have a need for reassurance
116:03
that your needs matter? yes
116:06
yes, i tried to tell you that for years you don't listen
116:15
now i'm feeling sad cause i'm not meeting the needs
116:22
hold your sadness she needs more empathy
116:28
this is what often happens we get to our feelings too quickly
116:33
with my help we've just got started we just... this is not the end
116:37
there's a lot more pain in there that she needs empathy for
116:40
before she can hear your sadness so, jackal, am i hearing you
116:44
that for you the real painful issue here is not being confident that your needs matter
116:50
my needs have never mattered in any relationship not in my family and not now
116:55
oh, so what's real painful is for you to feel that your needs matter
117:00
and this has been going on a long time yes
117:06
yes i do everything i can i've told him over and over again
117:13
so you do everything you know how and your needs still don't get responded to
117:17
it really hurts yes
117:20
uhm now you see it hasn't been easy for me to
117:25
give this jackal empathy i was wanting to jump in and educate him
117:28
but the way you're asking for it jackal is gonna make it hard for people to give it
117:32
to you i wanted to say that almost every time
117:36
so i had to take a deep breath and realize
117:39
empathic connection before education now is not the time to educate
117:49
that the way you're asking for it is going to make it
117:51
pretty hard for somebody without superpower giraffe ears
117:54
to hear your needs question on that:
118:01
doesn't this situation requires some kind of resolution?
118:04
or solution, or? yes, yes
118:06
and almost and the resolution, the solution
118:09
will find us when the connection is there now what connection?
118:16
you see
118:33
here's your wife's needs here's your needs
118:45
when she hears your needs without hearing any criticism or demand
118:54
and you hear her needs without any criticism and demand
118:59
the solution will find you the conflict will resolve itself
119:04
it does need to be resolved but what most of us do is
119:08
we skip this and go right to here
119:14
for example i sometimes do workshops
119:23
just with married couples or other people living together
119:26
in a love relationship and what we do to begin workshop
119:32
we identify the couple who has had a conflict the longest outstanding conflict that could
119:38
not be resolved and i make a prediction
119:45
and it's right my prediction has been accurate in a maybe
119:48
i'm sure at least 75% of the cases but my prediction is this:
119:53
that we will resolve the conflict within twenty minutes
119:58
within twenty minutes from the point at which both parts can tell me what the other party
120:04
is needing okay?
120:07
now, one time we found a couple married 39 years
120:13
39 years had a conflict had not been able to resolve this conflict
120:19
the wife said to me: marshall i could tell you right now
120:22
we're not gonna be able to resolve this within 20 minutes
120:26
we had a good marriage, we communicate well but this is just one of those things
120:31
that we're different people and we just have a conflict here
120:35
i said let me correct one thing i didn't say we were gonna resolve it in 20
120:39
minutes i said within 20 minutes from the point at
120:43
which you can both tell me what the other party
120:45
is needing oh, she said, marshall
120:48
we've been married for 39 years and you've talked about something almost every
120:51
day i can tell you, we understand each other
120:56
the problem isn't that we're just two different people
120:58
in this issue well, i said, i've been wrong before
121:02
i could sure be wrong this time but let's see
121:04
we'll find out within twenty minutes so, first, tell me what his needs are
121:08
in this situation he doesn't want me to spend any money
121:15
he responds immediately: that's ridiculous 39 years of communication
121:22
now first of all doesn't want me to spend any money is not
121:31
a need see needs and strategies need to be separated
121:36
they had been talking about how much money she could spend and not spend
121:39
but the more important issue there was whether who takes care of the checkbook
121:45
he you know unilaterally controlled the checkbook which was really the main issue between them
121:50
but that's... i'm saying i don't even want the couple
121:53
to talk about the strategies and the solutions
121:56
until the connection is there when the connection is there the conflict
122:00
usually resolve themselves so i parted out to her: no,
122:05
that's not a need and even if it was notice he's saying
122:07
that's not accurate she said: okay, let me then tell you
122:10
what his needs are, marshall you see, he's just like his own father
122:15
they both have a depression mentality when it comes to many
122:18
i, oh, said, stop now i'm hearing psychoanalytic jackal
122:23
you're that was gonna take another 39 years
122:28
if you get into that no i'm not asking for an analysis
122:33
of his personality i'm saying: what are his needs
122:37
she didn't know after 39 years
122:39
she had no awareness, consciousness of his needs
122:44
so i said to him, okay, well, she doesn't know -
122:47
why don't you tell her? well, marshall, let me tell you what her needs
122:51
are you see she's a lovely woman, lovely woman,
122:54
wonderful mother a wonderful wife
122:56
but when it comes to money she's totally irresponsible
123:01
here comes another 39 years, you see i asked for a need and he gives me a diagnosis
123:08
and of course, she immediately says that's unfair
123:11
i said hold it, hold it, hold it so, i could see they didn't have
123:16
need literacy so i have to loan them my ears
123:19
so, with giraffe ears, of course, i'm conscious all judgments -
123:25
she's totally irresponsible- is a tragic expression of an unmet need
123:33
so if she wold have have these ears they would have been able to resolve this
123:35
in the first year of their marriage but she didn't
123:37
she was taking it personally so i helped them out i said
123:41
when you say she's irresponsible are you feeling frightened and need to be
123:45
sure the family is protected economically?
123:48
he said: that's exactly what i mean well, it wasn't what he's been saying for
123:52
39 years but he didn't how to to say his feelings and
123:56
needs okay, so i've got his needs identified
123:59
he was scared wanted to protect the family economically
124:02
i turned to his wife and said: could you tell me back what you heard him
124:07
say but because i did - you know one time i overdrew
124:11
the checkbook, when we were, you know, first married, now he thinks...
124:13
i said excuse me notice what the first word she said was: but
124:18
see she doesn't know the cardinal giraffe rule:
124:23
never put your but in the face of an angry person
124:25
i said: what are his feelings and needs? but... no no no no
124:41
what are his feelings and needs? want me to repeat them?
124:47
yeah i hear him saying he's scared
124:50
well... but no, hold it, hold it
124:54
calm down, calm down, jackal hear his feelings and needs
124:58
see but after 39 years of enemy image it's not easy for somebody to shift this images
125:04
you see once we get one of these images in our mind
125:08
of the other person's wrongness even when they are expressing their needs
125:12
we don't hear it these enemy image are hard to get past
125:18
so she's been seeing him as cheap and having this depression mentality
125:23
for 39 years she can't see the human being behind her image
125:30
i said let me repeat it again i hear him saying he's scared
125:35
because he needs some... to protect the family needs to protect the family economically
125:40
can you say it back? yeah, he thinks i'm irresponsible
125:45
let's try it again after three more repetitions, finally, she
125:49
could hear his needs and feelings separate from her judgments
125:54
finally did you try to empathize with her point,
126:02
or did you just keep repeating his need and trying to get her...
126:07
yes, after i had tried twice to get her to hear it
126:10
i could see she was in too much pain to hear him
126:13
so i had to do what i was just demonstrating like this
126:15
actually, i needed to give her some emergency first aid empathy
126:21
before i could pull her by the ears to hear him
126:24
so after i try two times to pull the jackal by the ears it's
126:28
hard to do that cause he keeps trying to bite and then i back off
126:33
so i really hurts when you hear criticism? yes, yes I mean... blahaha
126:38
yeah, so and you really need to be trusted? yeah, blalaala
126:44
okay, now i'd like to repeat what he said and i'd like to have you tell me back what
126:49
he heard so yeah i did after do a little bit of cleaning
126:52
up the mess before
126:52
see every image that she's heard in the past, every criticism
126:58
that she'd heard for years that she was irresponsible
127:02
now it's hard for her to hear the need that was
127:04
being expressed all along behind that so finally i get her to hear his feelings
127:11
and needs okay, we're halfway through, now
127:13
this much took me an hour okay, now i try to help her
127:18
so could you tell me now what your needs are? well just because i made a mi... you know,
127:22
i overdrew the checkbook you know before you know
127:24
that doesn't mean i'm gonna do it again he said: yes we could be out of money...
127:27
excuse me, excuse me so, you're really frustrated and if i hear
127:36
you correctly you have a need for some trust that you can
127:39
learn how to handle money
127:42
yes okay
127:45
husband, could you tell me - yeah, we will be out of money by then
127:48
excuse me can you tell me what her feelings and needs
127:54
are would you like me to repeat it?
127:58
yes okay
128:01
about three more repetitions he hears her
128:05
it didn't take twenty minutes to resolve it at that point
128:10
whenever i go into situations where there's been
128:12
a lot of conflict i don't even allow the people to talk about strategies until they're connected
128:17
at the heart level i was working with two tribes in northern
128:21
nigeria one christian tribe, and one muslim tribe
128:26
one quarter of the population killed in one year
128:29
one out of four people got killed it took my colleague six months to get them
128:36
to agree to come into a room together
128:38
during that six months sixty people killed, so by the time that took
128:41
us to get everybody into a room together sixty people killed
128:44
so, now it's not a husband and wife i have at the opposite
128:47
ends of a table but the chiefs of two tribes
128:53
i start the same way i did with the husband and wife
128:55
i'd like to hear you express your needs what needs are not being met?
129:01
i'm pretty much guessing ahead of time i'm not gonna
129:02
get an answer to my question cause, if people have been communicating at
129:06
the need level there wouldn't have been a hundred people
129:08
dead so i wasn't surprised when instead of getting
129:13
an answer to my question i got this back:
129:15
these people are murderers well you've been trying to dominate us
129:20
i asked for needs, and get back diagnoses so just as with the husband and wife, i put
129:28
my ears on translate each statement to a need
129:35
get the other side to hear it it wasn't easy
129:37
i gotta do a lot of first aid empathy to get cause like when i
129:43
got this person behind murderers was so you are frightened of any years of
129:46
violence to resolve conflict
129:48
and want some agreement to resolve it in some other way
129:51
yes exactly okay, could you say back what you heard
129:54
then why did you kill my child? so, it wasn't too easy
129:58
but, anyway, after, it took about an hour for me
130:04
to get one need expressed, one need heard one need expressed, one need heard
130:10
and one of the chiefs who hadn't spoken yet said to me:
130:13
if we'd know how to communicate this way we won't have to kill each other
130:17
it just took one hour to see if they can just stay connected at the heart
130:22
level nobody has to die
130:24
there's plenty of resources of getting everybody's needs met
130:28
but we lose that when we get up into our head and start to analyse wrongness
130:34
yes? but does this need understanding develop into
130:38
a well sort of a not necessarily give and take
130:41
but when one person would give in to the other person
130:43
no, no compromising in giraffe not necessary to compromise
130:47
everybody's needs can get met nobody has to give in
130:51
nobody has to give anything up cause i agree with what you have to say in
130:55
specially when it comes to doing things for other people
130:57
because if, my theory is, that if i do something for someone else, that gives the person power
131:04
over me well
131:05
or is it if i do it for myself... i would put it this way: if you do anything
131:08
that involves giving in, both people pay for it
131:13
nothing has been resolved it's gonna create problems
131:18
so is there a needs dialogue, or needs literacy mentioned
131:21
i have need literacy in my book and if you wanna develop your book literacy
131:28
i suggest you to do the following activity:
131:32
first, identify your most frequently used jackals
131:38
the ones you use the most and next, the ones you are the most afraid
131:41
of do it this way:
131:43
first, on a list make a list of how you talk to yourself when
131:47
you're less than perfect
131:51
and those of you over here who say you're perfect
131:52
you have to skip this part but for those of you who aren't perfect
131:58
make a list of how are you most likely to speak to yourself
132:04
when you're less than perfect so that's jackal list number one
132:09
next, make a second list what are the jackal messages that'd go on
132:17
in you when you are angry at others?
132:19
so, when you're judging others and are angry
132:23
what are you most likely to be saying to yourself or out loud about the other person
132:29
so that's jackal list number two jackal list number three:
132:35
list those things that when other people say it
132:40
at the moment you respond to defensively or aggressively
132:43
and put on that list things that you have been so afraid
132:48
that people might think of you that you've become a nice dead person to avoid
132:53
it so in other words put into that list
132:57
not only what people have said that got you defensive,
132:59
but of things you're scared they might say okay, now do this exercise to build your need
133:05
literacy go back over that first list
133:08
where you... what you say to yourself when you're less than perfect
133:12
now, for each judgment think of what might've been the stimulus for
133:17
it see you gotta relate each of these specific
133:20
contexts so, say to yourself
133:24
let's say the first thing is you have on your list
133:26
this number one what a dumb thing to do!
133:30
okay think of what you might have done
133:34
to stimulate it okay
133:37
then put on giraffe ears and hear the need behind "stupid"
133:42
see i'm saying that all judgments are tragic expressions of unmet
133:47
needs so ask yourself if when i say that to myself
133:51
in that situation how stupid
133:54
what need am i expressing through that judgment what need of mine isn't getting met
134:01
and here's what you could use in the list in my book
134:04
if you can't come up with it yourself just look through the list and your body will
134:09
tell you when you're getting close
134:10
really, cause - ah yeah, yeah, that's what i needed
134:15
see if the need comes much closer to the truth than any judgment you make of yourself
134:22
so do that for any other item on your list second, what you tell yourself
134:28
when you're angry at others again, identify concretely
134:32
what the other person might have done to stimulate this
134:37
then ask yourself this question: when i judge people
134:39
as idiots who're doing that what need of mine was not being met in that
134:44
situation again, try to guess without my list, but if
134:49
you can't find it look through my list to find when
134:51
it comes closest the third list, what others say to you
134:56
to get you defensive practice putting on the giraffe ears
135:01
and imagine what you did to stimulate it and in that situation guess what the other
135:06
person's needs were that weren't getting met
135:10
so you see it's just learning a new language learning where everytime there are these jackal
135:14
judgments to as quickly as possible to bring yourself
135:18
back to life or more specifically connect to needs
135:23
needs are life yes?
135:28
my question is, i never know what to do when i know i'm never gonna meet another person's
135:37
you know, expectation of me yes, well, first of all
135:40
never hear an expectation that's that's thoughts
135:43
expectations are thoughts don't hear it
135:48
don't even hear expectations hear what the need is
135:52
what is the need that the person is asking for you to meet
135:55
you don't wanna live up to expectations but it is fun to meet needs
136:02
do you think that every... that human beings can always meet other people's needs if they're
136:08
real? all of our needs can be met
136:11
i don't think you have to do it there's several billion other people that
136:14
could meet the other person's need even if you could do it
136:17
you may choose not to and that won't be a problem
136:21
the other person can hear a no, if they first feel empathy
136:25
for their feelings and needs that will leave them feeling at least that
136:30
their feelings and needs matter that makes sense
136:35
but then again you have to know how to say no in giraffe
136:38
that would be good for me to learn well let me help you out
136:42
never use the following words when you're saying no in giraffe:
136:48
no. I can't. I don't want to. I don't have time. It's not possible.
137:01
Now you know how not to do it, right? so here's how you do it
137:07
to say no in giraffe you need to be conscious that a no is a pure expression of the need
137:15
so say the need that keeps you from saying yes
137:22
no so if you had giraffe ears just now
137:29
you wouldn't have heard me saying no you would have said:
137:32
what is marshall's need that's keeping him from saying yes?
137:34
and you might have said back to me: marshall are you having a need for completion
137:38
of other things you'd like to do right now?
137:41
you see, you would have tried to hear the need behind the no
137:45
so what i said is all nos are tragic expressions of a need
137:52
so say the need that keeps you from saying yes
137:55
don't say no the way that i have this framed
138:00
i feel as though i am responding to a person's expectations
138:06
so it's a work environment um, are you feeling afraid of being held responsible
138:12
for the quality and quantity of the work that i'm doing?
138:15
and this is to a supervisor are you feeling scared and need to protect
138:21
yourself? that might be the need that i hear you're
138:25
guessing are you feeling scared and need to protect
138:28
yourself in this manner? i guess when i hear that i feel afraid
138:35
because i'm inferring that there's a danger in that they have a fear of some danger
138:41
if this is what you're guessing is alive in them,
138:43
we're not saying it's right see we never say you are feeling
138:46
we're always saying are you feeling we may be wrong but
138:50
we're trying to get clear what's going on in this person
138:52
are you feeling afraid and need to protect yourself?
138:56
and taking the my performance part part out of it
138:59
you're saying take the me out of the... try to hear the feelings and needs without
139:04
you you know we know what that is in this situation
139:10
they're talking to you about some things you've done
139:12
or haven't done so in the context we're pretty clear what's going
139:16
on what we wanna hear now is their feelings and
139:19
needs are you feeling scared and need to protect
139:22
yourself in this manner? now if this is in many settings where the
139:31
people are not used to having feelings dealt with
139:36
the other person might get very upset with having their feelings being talked about
139:43
in which case you do it silently if you're a giraffe you hear feelings and
139:47
needs in every message whether you do it out loud or not
139:52
politically we adjust when we might do it out loud but
139:56
we don't allow anything else into our consciousness except this other person's feelings and needs
140:04
i think you said earlier that there's no compromise in
140:07
giraffe communication yes
140:09
and so i would find it instructional to know how the problem between husband and wife was
140:14
resolved yes
140:16
and how it was a winning situation for both of them?
140:20
first, once there is empathy, people feel that their feelings and needs matter
140:25
which is done through the empathy you don't have the competitiveness
140:31
you don't have the charge so here's how it went
140:33
after they both heard each other he heard that it would really hurt for her
140:37
not to be trusted that she could learn
140:43
and once he felt really understood how scared he was that if she were to do what
140:48
she did when they first got married
140:49
and overdrew the account she could hear that he wanted to protect the
140:54
family i think most six year old children
140:57
could resolve the conflicts that get nations into wars in which thousands are killed
141:02
if you gave the six year olds... you said, look: here are the needs on both
141:06
sides here are the resources
141:09
i'm confident most six year old could solve the conflict
141:14
so in this it doesn't take a genius what did they do? she said: I want a trial
141:20
period to learn how to do it
141:22
first he said: I'm scared, cause, you know you could go through a lot of money, learning
141:28
so, she agreed during the trial period he would supervise her
141:32
until he felt comfortable that she knew how to do it
141:35
okay, that took about seven minutes but they haven't been able to get to that
141:41
in 39 years cause of all the enemy images, the hurt and
141:46
so forth how do you deal with a situation when you
141:56
have a similar needs and you attempt to express them
142:02
to each other and you sense, as the emotions build up, because
142:11
of apparent competitive edge working that our mutual needs are not being heard
142:19
but either... or the jackals then you either need to get a third party
142:26
to give both of them the empathy they need to hear each other
142:30
so if two people are in pain they don't know how to give themselves enough
142:36
empathy to be able to hear the other side then you need to get a third party
142:41
to give the empathy to each of them so that they can then hear each other
142:51
and that third party is, should be together with these
142:56
two individuals, or separately? there's different ways to do that
143:00
if they're together there're some advantages but it could be that to give empathy to both
143:07
sides separately and then help each side to hear the other
143:11
side then bring them together
143:16
thank you part four: questions and expressing and receiving
143:26
gratitude this morning you made a reference to giraffe
143:30
mourning and that there's a different way of saying
143:33
you're sorry to someone and i wanted to hear what that was
143:36
okay, let's real quick look at what i mean by giraffe mourning
143:40
think of something you did that you wished you hadn't done
143:44
and identify, recall as best you can how you talked to yourself when you said it
143:55
or did it, whatever you did it so, what did you do
144:01
that you wished you hadn't done after you had done it?
144:05
and give me a sample of what you said to yourself when you did it
144:17
that, i was feeling defensive and i criticised someone
144:27
so, what you did is that you said some things to another person
144:31
that you wished you hadn't done right
144:33
okay, and what did you say to yourself, when you did that?
144:38
well usually in the moment i feel you know defensive with myself
144:42
no i wanna concretely know for this exercise i need to know concretely what you say to
144:48
yourself when you behave in a way you don't like
144:51
this is very important to answer your question about
144:54
giraffe mourning it's very important to identify your inner
145:00
what your inner educator is saying to you see this, all of us have an inner educator
145:06
who's function it is to educate us when we are less than perfect
145:11
now, most of us made the mistake of sending our inner educator off
145:17
to a brutal jackal academy for inner educators
145:24
and so, it's important to be conscious of how
145:28
our inner educator talks to us that's what i'm asking you -
145:31
when you said what you did to your husband what did your inner educator
145:36
how did your inner educator try to educate you?
145:39
it said what to you about what you had done? in the moment, or later?
145:43
either one well, the point when i start to feel regret
145:48
or sorry is later at any point, what did you say to yourself
145:53
about what you had done okay i said i'm a bad person
145:56
now, that's enough see, your inner educator tries to educate
146:03
you through penitence
146:07
through making you hate yourself for what you've done
146:10
it uses language that implies there's such a thing
146:13
as a bad person alright
146:16
now, if you apologize out of that energy
146:20
that's jackal any apology that comes out of thinking
146:25
you did something wrong is not gonna be good for you
146:28
or the other person you with me so far?
146:33
i know it feels bad yeah, and i really want you to feel bad
146:38
in this situation but i want you to feel a sweet bad
146:44
a sweet bad that will help you learn from this without hating yourself
146:49
when you have a thought in your head that you're a bad person
146:52
that's ugly bad that's a punitive bad
146:55
that will first it will make it hard to learn and even if you do learn it's out of self-hatred
147:01
so whatever changes you make are at great cost
147:03
mhm so, that's your inner educator
147:08
that was your inner educator speaking to you when it said you're a bad person
147:11
now, we've been learning today that all judgments are expressions of needs,
147:19
right? so your inner educator means well
147:22
it really means well it wants you to learn from this
147:26
in a way that will serve life it means well, it's just its language that
147:31
sucks okay?
147:34
so we don't wanna hear what the educator thinks about us
147:38
we wanna hear the need that isn't getting met
147:40
that it's trying to call to our attention so what need is your inner educator trying
147:46
to bring to your attention that you didn't meet
147:48
by how you behaved? uh, a need to... be in a relationship with the other
148:05
person? need... what kind of relationship?
148:08
a mutual, understanding, respectful yeah, right
148:11
so it didn't meet your need for respecting and understanding the other person
148:17
and how do you feel when that need isn't met? guilty
148:27
then you still got the bad person image in mind
148:30
if you still think you're a bad... if there's any thinking
148:32
still going on, that guilt comes from the judgment
148:36
well, i feel separate, and isolated but how do you feel, what emotions do you
148:41
feel about not meeting your own needs
148:44
for understanding and respecting? see, the guilt comes from that image
148:48
of bad person but, what feeling comes from not meeting your
148:52
need to respond to this person with respect and
148:55
understanding? sad?
148:59
that's a sweet pain that's giraffe mourning
149:05
so if you say to the person, you know the way i talk to you, i feel really sad
149:10
it doesn't meet my need for respecting you and understanding you
149:19
you see there's no image in there that i'm a bad person
149:21
i'm sad, i didn't meet my own need for respecting and understanding
149:27
check with the other person what they'd rather hear
149:31
whether they'd rather hear the giraffe mourning or the apology that you're a bad person
149:38
yes? I'm having a little problem trying to find
149:47
the teeth in this model somehow
149:51
it seems everything, even now, is on a feeling level, everything seems
149:56
the way i'm interpreting it, anyways, sort of on a mental level as opposed to an
150:01
emotional level and i guess i operate a lot from my gut
150:05
and i'm trying to get down to that somehow so i need some help with it
150:10
basically, tell me how i would be able to use this
150:16
technique in my daily life and make it...
150:24
so that it's natural you know it's not natural for me to operate
150:28
this way first thing i would recommend to you
150:31
is change the world natural to habitual change the word natural to habitual
150:38
i think this process is natural more natural than the way you were trained
150:42
to think so gandhi says it's very dangerous
150:45
to mix up the words natural and habitual he says we have been trained to be quite
150:50
habitual at communicating in ways that are quite unnatural
150:54
so, i can't think of a more natural way to communicate
151:00
than to talk about what's alive in us just what we're feeling and needing
151:05
but if you feel like saying if i feel like saying no
151:09
saying no seems okay to me for what you were saying before was that
151:14
what you mean by okay? it's okay to say no?
151:16
what do you mean by what do i mean? pardon?
151:21
we can go back and forth like this yes, so let me be more specific
151:27
when you say no i predict that by saying no
151:34
more often that you would like the other person is going to react to you
151:38
in a way that isn't in your well... in your best interests
151:43
but if you say the need behind the no that's less likely to happen
151:47
so then, if i understand what you're saying the idea's that to communicate in a way
151:54
that the other person would communicate back to you so that's in my best interest
152:00
i'm saying the purpose of this process is just to get
152:03
everybody's needs met and that the needs are met by people giving
152:06
willingly not out of any coercive motivation
152:10
and i'm saying that when you say no it gets in the way of the likelihood
152:15
that everybody's needs are going to end up getting met
152:16
if you say the need that keeps you from saying yes
152:25
i predict there's more likelihood that everybody's needs will end up being met
152:29
so, if i understand what you are saying is to just express your needs
152:38
without saying a no i'm saying the need is a clearer expression
152:43
of what you're trying to say then no you get clear, more connected to life
152:49
when you say the need that keeps you from saying yes
152:52
than just saying no and it's less likely to be interpreted as
152:56
a rejection as you being defensive
152:58
to say the no by itself i predict it's more likely to get you interpretations
153:06
that aren't in your best interests sometimes when i don't hear a no
153:09
i look at it at being sort of passive-aggressive response
153:15
to something that i might want someone, you know, let's say if i make and
153:21
appointment with somebody
153:23
and instead of them saying no, they don't show up
153:26
yes and then they give me a reason why they don't
153:27
show up yes, i'm not suggesting that
153:30
i'm not suggesting that response i'm suggesting that i would have liked that
153:35
person to have told you honestly at their time what their need was
153:39
i think if they had done that you wouldn't have gotten into that situation
153:45
they said a yes that wasn't so some people are... won't say i'm afraid
153:52
pardon? let's say if the reason is that they're afraid
153:54
to that would depend a lot on what has happened
153:55
in the past to them when they had said no
153:57
in whatever way they did it if they had not enjoyed very empathic responses
154:07
to it in the past than they're probably
154:08
afraid of being honest about it now
154:11
i see the value in all this i really do
154:15
i guess it's the idea that it's a touchy-feely type of thing
154:18
that i'm not used to working around what you're trying to figure out
154:22
if i'm understanding is how to really put this into
154:24
a idiom that you can use daily and feels comfortable to
154:28
that's one way of putting it yeah
154:31
and so, in our training we first show people how
154:34
to develop the literacy and then how to put it
154:38
into their regular language i had a student traveling with me
154:44
and he wanted to give me a gratitude, okay?
154:50
and he liked something i did i was really working a group hard
154:53
and during the break he said dictator
154:59
that was giraffe because he knew that i knew what he was reacting
155:05
to he knew i wouldn't hear a judgment
155:08
he knew i would guess in there what he was feeling and needing
155:09
you see, so who could say that? dictator so after we really know how to clearly identify
155:17
our feelings, needs, requests then we can start putting it into language
155:22
that can can connect us with the people we're speaking with
155:26
but in, at this stage of day after one day
155:28
i'm still working with you on making sure you understand what a feeling and a need is
155:33
cause if you don't really understand that it's gonna be hard to how to then put it into
155:37
your idiom i guess i'm a recovering new york jackal,
155:43
you know i'm getting the impression that
155:47
apology isn't really the best service of being a giraffe
155:54
i'd like to know if you could model i'd like to see you model for me an acknowledgment
156:01
of missing the mark sinning courageously
156:07
if you recall earlier i showed an example of that
156:10
where i'd show the person saying i feel sad i would like to have responded
156:15
with more understanding than i did
156:17
so you're not using the word i'm sorry you're saying i'm sad
156:21
it's not so much the word i'm sorry what we shifted from was thinking
156:25
that i did something wrong that it was bad
156:28
it's that thinking that is the problem and the i'm sorry follows from that thinking
156:34
so it's not just that i don't say i'm sorry i say i'm sad - if i'm sad
156:38
see the word i'm sorry means almost nothing it's a feeling
156:41
people can say that and not feel anything you say that to buy forgiveness
156:48
so if i'm feeling sad i say that
156:50
i'm feeling sad i would have liked to have been
156:53
more aware of your needs, for example i didn't take the person's needs into consideration
156:58
but i don't say i'm sorry that was inconsiderate of me
157:02
there's no self blame i didn't do anything wrong
157:06
there is no such thing as doing anything wrong what i did was not in harmony with my needs
157:13
i wanna mourn that i'm sad i would have like to have been more
157:16
aware of your needs something like that
157:18
does that give you the example? very much so thank you
157:22
yeah another question over here
157:25
your left uh
157:27
i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together
157:34
we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate
157:43
that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate
157:47
i said it was undoable ok, right
157:50
that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy
157:57
tell me the action to get there that i can do
158:02
if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that
158:05
i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful
158:08
tell me the action don't just tell me be happy
158:11
don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do
158:15
to feel that confidence the action will get me there
158:18
but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind
158:24
okay well one of the other things would be when we get together
158:31
i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not
158:37
in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness
158:40
or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a
158:42
good mood and i'll be in a one
158:46
but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood
158:48
for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood
158:55
okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times
159:04
when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother
159:13
soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me
159:17
figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay
159:20
and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do:
159:24
and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse
159:29
okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it
159:34
if it gets worse but first let me show you
159:38
the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider
159:41
another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that
159:47
what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing
159:52
this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent
159:57
in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in
160:01
and want to show me all the things that could be done
160:05
you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip
160:08
and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes
160:11
yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna
160:18
contribute to it yeah
160:21
that's step one see what i mean
160:23
that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding
160:26
now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this
160:33
that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting
160:37
people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another
160:41
way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure
160:45
they don't hate themselves for what they're doing
160:47
the more they hate themself for what they're doing
160:50
the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their
160:56
needs are in doing it
160:57
okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day
161:03
with i tell honestly how i feel
161:07
i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent
161:10
but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year
161:14
cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know
161:16
what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself
161:19
so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother
161:23
so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me
161:38
now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection
161:44
she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that
161:50
her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would
161:56
be impossible for a person to react this way
161:58
if they heard it they would have gotten a gift
162:01
they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus
162:06
that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now
162:10
so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say?
162:14
you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother
162:20
of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it
162:25
as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said
162:31
see if you wanna make it
162:34
if you want to have people understand you differently
162:36
never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said
162:43
say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard
162:47
i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother
162:51
cause i do value very much that you're offering to help
162:54
but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and
162:57
structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say?
163:04
so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you?
163:08
thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother
163:11
i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs
163:16
that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my
163:20
own time could you tell me what you heard?
163:24
so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself
163:28
what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother
163:32
see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right?
163:41
now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know
163:45
but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal
163:48
thank you yes?
163:53
you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering
164:02
could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes
164:04
that's very important thank you for being in debt to me about it
164:08
okay, a friend of yours says this to you: i'm a nothing
164:17
i'll never amount to anything look at... i'm an assistant clerk at 8's 45
164:23
my brother's a head of his company my sister's a top attorney
164:29
and i'm a nothing okay?
164:34
now, to enjoy this person's suffering we have to release ourself from two kinds
164:39
of responsibility first, that we didn't cause the pain
164:46
that we wanna release ourself from that especially if the other person's trying to make us believe
164:51
we did cause the pain if this person had started: and you're at
164:55
fault for all of this, why i'm a nothing
164:58
especially when a person says that we do not want to in any way think
165:02
we caused this person's pain cause you can't cause another person's
165:06
psychological pain well in this case the person wasn't saying
165:11
that so that's pretty easy to
165:14
liberate ourself from feeling responsible but the second one is the hard one
165:21
to think we have to fix it to make the person feel better
165:25
the more we think it's our job to make the person feel better
165:29
the more we're gonna make it worse cause you can't fix people
165:33
the good news is, you don't have to there is a very powerful healing energy
165:40
always available if we don't block it
165:45
and how do we block that energy? by trying to fix things ourself
165:52
so how do we help that energy to do the job? by empathy
165:58
empathy requires presence just to be present
166:02
when we are just present when we are remembering the buddhist advice:
166:06
don't do something, stand there when we do that, and that energy works through
166:14
us there is a precious connection between that
166:18
person and us and that precious connection is what i mean
166:23
by enjoyment to enjoy that precious connection
166:26
and whether this person's feeling joy or pain
166:32
if we are present there with them that's what i mean
166:38
but we block that beautiful energy whenever we step in and think we have to fix things
166:44
so we say, oh, there there you'll feel better you'll get over
166:46
we make it worse when we start to give advice
166:50
we make it worse so what does that look like?
166:56
so you're feeling really discouraged and really would like to have achieved more
167:01
in your life at this moment than you've done yes, yes, had every opportunity, and look
167:05
at me i've just never made use of anything
167:07
yeah, so you're really discouraged and frustrated and would really have liked to make
167:14
different use of some things than you have yeah
167:18
see? i'm just present not trying to fix it
167:22
and when that happens there's a very precious connection
167:26
that's what i mean by enjoyment and that precious connection does the healing
167:31
not your advice, not your whatever yes?
167:35
can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the
167:43
soap opera of you know, somebody who is
167:47
somebody who is suffering and sometimes by being there it's sort of
167:55
a subtle encouragement as opposed to
167:59
the subtle encouragement that i think you're talking about comes about
168:04
when this person is talking about what happened to them
168:07
for the fiftieth time you heard the story so, if i'm really listening to them
168:12
i don't hear what they talk about the past cause i know that the more they talk about
168:17
the past the less healing will take place
168:21
so i interrupt but i interrupt to bring the conversation
168:25
to life they're talking about the past and
168:28
i interrupt then and i say excuse me but sounds like right now you're still
168:32
feeling hurt because your need for respect wasn't met in
168:37
that see, cause just letting them talk about the
168:40
past and asking them questions about what happened
168:43
about the past is to just keep the soap opera going
168:47
so i interrupt when they talk about the past cause we don't heal by talking about the past
168:54
we heal by talking about what's alive in us right now
168:57
stimulated by the past but it's what's here now
169:01
and when i connect at that level they won't keep talking about it
169:07
they'll heal last question and then i'm going to get into
169:11
the subject that i'd like to cover before the end
169:16
yes? you talk about having
169:23
if someone else can not cause our emotional pain
169:27
that's right and i think about
169:32
the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in a lot of families
169:36
and the suffering that i've experienced throughout my life
169:39
through my recovery and all that yes and other people were a stimulus for
169:44
your suffering and you were participant in how you dealt
169:48
with it for example:
169:52
if you follow me in my work you would see this
169:53
very clearly in places like rwanda, burundi, sierra leone
170:01
i'm working with people that have had their families killed
170:04
some of those people have such rage that all they live for, moment by moment,
170:09
is the possibility of vengeance others have no anger
170:14
have never had anger same exact stimulus
170:17
they have deep feelings but not rage
170:21
so it is not the stimulus that determines how our emotional reaction is
170:26
that part is up to us i work with some women
170:32
unfortunately a lot who've been raped
170:35
and some of them feel shame deep shame
170:41
some feel rage some feel other things
170:45
so the same stimulus depends on how people take it
170:50
whether they feel shame, rage, or other things i'm working with a woman from rwanda
170:58
she heard her three children being killed cause she got... to underneath the sink
171:02
hid underneath the sink in time her children didn't make it
171:05
to the hiding place in time they got killed she heard them
171:08
she heard her husband being killed and her brother
171:11
she had to stay underneath there eleven days to save her own life
171:15
cause they stayed in their house after they killed the family
171:19
this woman has deep feelings but never once has she had that kind of anger
171:24
that makes her wanna get vengeance she's put all of her feelings
171:27
and lots of them into protecting preventing this happening to anybody else
171:33
you see, so the way she looked at it leads her to want to prevent this happening
171:37
to anybody else she came to my workshop
171:40
because she wanted to know how to deal with the rage toward her
171:43
from other people in her tribe who are furious with her
171:46
that she won't join their efforts to kill the other people
171:52
same stimulus quite different reactions
171:56
okay, so i had this stimulus and somewhere i learned how to deal with it
172:02
in a way that i had to deal with it and i'm learning to change that now
172:06
the worst thing of course would be to now matter how you did choose to deal with
172:09
it is to think there's something wrong with how
172:10
you chose to deal with it
172:11
that not wanting us to get into one way is right or wrong
172:15
I'm just saying that no matter what happens to us
172:18
the other person's responsible for what they did
172:21
i'm not saying the other person doesn't have responsibility
172:23
that's my question about accountability that person's responsible for what they did
172:27
and why they did it we're responsible for how we deal with that
172:33
okay? i'm just wondering how a child becomes responsible
172:43
i mean still you know the first thing i do
172:46
i wouldn't wanna teach the child the lesson i just taught you
172:49
until i had given that child all the empathy that child needed
172:52
and i guess it would be a lot so i can see myself dealing with a long time
172:58
of hearing this child's enormous pain
173:01
as a result of this but then, in the course of this
173:05
i would be seeing this child having some pain created by how they looked
173:10
at it so i would see that they're creating
173:13
pain on top of the pain by how they looked at it
173:18
so, after the child had all the empathy he or she needed
173:23
then i would do what i could to get them to see it in a way that
173:27
wouldn't create unnecessary pain for themself this is a debut jackal, yes
173:42
okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time
173:45
that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe
173:48
cause i wouldn't want you to get the idea that non-violent communication
173:53
is solely interested in conflict resolution because it's equally interested
173:58
in celebration how can we celebrate life
174:02
in fact the part that i've left for ten minutes before the end
174:05
is in some respects the most important part because it's where we get
174:09
the fuel to stay giraffe in what's often a very jackalish world
174:17
so it's gonna be pretty hard to make this radical transformation
174:20
to back to our nature in many situations unless we're getting plenty
174:27
of fuel now where does this fuel come from
174:32
the fuel comes from celebration and what kind of celebration?
174:37
comes from saying thank you in giraffe so let's see now in the last minutes
174:43
how we celebrate by saying thank you in giraffe
174:47
expressing gratitude in giraffe and first i'd like to remind you
174:53
of how jackals say thank you: you did a good job on that paper
175:01
you are a very kind person you're a good dancer
175:07
can you see why that's jackal? moralistic judgments
175:13
positive moralistic judgments are equally as violent in my estimation
175:20
as negative ones mainly they reinforce the idea that
175:23
the negative exist if i say you're a kind person
175:27
i'm implying there's such a thing as an unkind person
175:30
i'm also implying that i'm the judge that knows the difference
175:35
so no more praise or compliments, okay? no more praise or compliments
175:39
especially if you intend them as a reward that's the ultimate dehumanization
175:45
to use thank you as a reward to say it for the purpose of
175:50
trying to reinforce something to get the person to continue doing it
175:54
it's like sending a... you know, what what gets on at dog obedience
176:00
school? punishment and rewards
176:03
giving a compliment or praise for the purpose of reinforcement is giving the dog a
176:08
something to eat, to reinforce it for something people are not for that treatment
176:14
and it destroys the beauty of thank you
176:18
when people have to wonder - is this being said out of that energy?
176:24
but it works! what does, jackal?
176:27
studies in management indicate that if managers praise and compliment employees
176:32
they lead production goes up studies in school show that if teachers
176:38
praise and compliment students daily they work harder
176:42
jackal, take another look at the research i think you'll see that that only works
176:47
for a very short time until people see the manipulation
176:51
and then it no longer works and it destroys the beauty of thank you
176:58
because now you can not even trust gratitude
177:02
without wondering whether it's being used as a reinforcement
177:05
as a reward well, what about if i wanna build up the other
177:10
person's self-esteem? what's wrong with that?
177:13
so, you, jackal, you don't see the irony of that?
177:17
what? if the other person can only like themself
177:20
if you compliment them they have no self-esteem
177:22
you just addicted them to your rewards that they only feel good when you say
177:28
something about them they have no self-esteem
177:33
okay how does a giraffe say thank you?
177:38
or gratitude? first, there's three things that are involved
177:42
in giraffe expression of gratitude that give
177:45
us energy to keep being a giraffe
177:47
the first thing in the giraffe expression of gratitude
177:51
is we bring to this other person's attention concretely, what they have done
177:57
that has made life more wonderful for us see, that's what we need to do, daily
178:03
we need to bring our consciousness and attention to the power that each one of
178:09
us has to make life more wonderful
178:14
each of us is a power house we have words that have the power
178:22
to contribute to making people's lives more wonderful
178:28
we have touch, we can touch people in ways that can make life more wonderful
178:34
we can provide services for other people we are powerhouses
178:40
the more we remember this we'll not get caught up in any violent games
178:47
why would we use our energy any way other than to make life wonderful
178:52
when we remember that we have this power so that's one thing we gotta make clear
178:58
in our expression of gratitude specifically what the person did
179:02
not some vague generality for example, a woman in Geneva, Switzerland,
179:08
came up to me at the end of a workshop here's what she said to me:
179:12
you're brilliant i said, doesn't help
179:17
she said: what do you mean? i said, you know ma'am, i have been called
179:22
a lot of names in my life really, i have, some positive, and some far
179:27
less than positive and i can never recall learning anything valuable
179:31
by somebody telling me what i am i think there's zero information value in
179:37
being told what you are
179:39
and great danger - you might believe it and it's just as dangerous to believe that
179:44
you're smart as that you're stupid
179:46
both of them reduce you to a thing we're much more than either of those
179:57
but i can see in your eyes that you want to express some gratitude
180:01
yes - and i wanna receive it, but doesn't help me to be told what i am
180:05
what do you need to hear? what did i do to make life more wonderful
180:09
for you? well, you're so intelligent
180:12
no, doesn't help doesn't help. what did i do?
180:17
oh, i got you. she opens up her notebook she shows me two things that i had said she
180:24
had written down she put a big star by them
180:27
see, that helps me now, okay that helps me to know that somehow my saying
180:33
those two things made this person's life more wonderful
180:38
so that's the first thing we need to say in appreciation
180:42
we need to bring to the person's attention concretely what they did
180:46
that made life more wonderful second, at the moment we're giving the gratitude
180:52
to say how we feel at that moment about the person having done that
180:58
so i said to this woman: could you tell me how you feel now
181:02
as a result of my having said those two things? she said: hopeful and relieved
181:07
oh, hopeful and relieved that gives me much more than telling me what
181:13
i am that i'm brilliant
181:16
just to know that somehow my saying those two things
181:18
now this person feels hopeful and relieved now when i hear the third thing i'll be able
181:25
to really enjoy this gratitude i said: what need of yours was fulfilled by
181:32
my saying what i did that leaves you feeling hopeful and relieved?
181:37
and that's the third thing we need to see in a giraffe gratitude
181:42
she said: i have an 18-year old son i'd never been able to connect with him
181:48
it's been very painful that we never can connect and i have needed some direction
181:54
to help me connect with him those two things you said
181:57
met my need for some concrete direction so, had she expressed her gratitude in giraffe
182:06
she would have said, marshall, when you said these two things, showed me
182:10
what the two things were it leaves me feeling hopeful and relieved
182:14
it meets a need of mine to connect with my son in a way that i want
182:21
okay, that's how we say gratitude in giraffe those three things
182:25
and it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude
182:34
jackal, when you offered to give me the ride just now over to where i'm going afterwards
182:39
i feel very grateful because i really have a need to spend
182:42
more time with my family and if i took the bus
182:45
i'd have an hour less time it's nothing
182:56
if you wanna terrorize a jackal, express love or appreciation to him
183:01
really, if you really wanna scared jackal i've never seen anything scare jackal-speaking
183:08
people more than sincere gratitude or love
183:12
why do you get so nervous, jackal, when you hear it?
183:16
well, i don't know that i deserved it see. jackals have this dangerous concept in
183:24
their head - "deserve". a very violent concept
183:28
it implies that you have to deserve appreciation you have to... you do deserve punishment if
183:36
you behave in a certain way see the concept of deserve is a key ingredient
183:40
in a violent way of life if you believe in deserve you believe certain
183:45
things are worth things and you set up a very destructive economic
183:49
system you'll set up a destructive correctional system
183:53
very dangerous concept well, it's not the only reason
183:59
why else do you get so scared when you hear gratitude, jackal?
184:05
what's wrong with being humble? so, you want to, have a need for humility
184:13
yes well, you know, jackal, there's different
184:16
kinds of humility i'm afraid that your kind is a jackal humility
184:19
i think that your kind is the kind that golda meir
184:22
the israeli prime minister was reacting to when she said to one of her politicians:
184:28
don't be so humble, you're not that great but the main reason that i believe that gratitude
184:40
is so scary for many of us to receive
184:43
is beautifully and poetically written in the course of miracles
184:48
where they say it's our light, not our darkness, that scares us the most
184:53
see we have been educated in this jackal way to hate ourselves
185:00
to think there's something wrong with us it's a big jump, to really see what i was
185:06
saying that we have enormous power to make life wonderful
185:11
and there's nothing we enjoy doing more than exercising that power
185:18
that's unfortunately a pretty big jump for us to come to
185:22
but we can come to it so that's how we say... gratitude
185:26
observation, feeling and need same literacy
185:30
make sure it's coming from the heart to celebrate and never to praise, compliment, reward
185:38
so any last comments or questions before our time runs up?
185:45
i'm grateful for all your time and attention today
